        about: "Welcome to the home of the cinema revolution., What is Cinebur?, Cinebur is a platform that connects moviegoers to unique screenings through our app. We have a host network, like Airbnb for movies, where venues can host cinema-like screenings that moviegoers can attend. Cinebur‘s film festival is an extension of our platform, to offer indie filmmakers the chance to screen their films to live audiences alongside award winning independent films that have gone to compete in Cannes, Berlin, TIFF and Sundance., How it works:, On Cinebur, we license indie films from big distributors like FiGa Films or New Europe Film Sales the same way MUBI or Netflix does for their platforms. Except instead of online VOD, we distribute films via non-theatrical exhibition in live screenings. At the same time, we also give more up-and-coming filmmakers the chance to submit their films and screen them in our network, either before an official screening, or as part of our Cinebur Film Festival screening every June. Our venue network includes boutique hotels, wineries, art studios, villas and even charities that host screening experiences to our hundreds of users., We only screen movies to live audiences:, Cinebur might just be the first real global film festival. No, we don‘t mean streaming your film to people‘s smartphones - we‘re not an online festival; and no, we don‘t just mean we‘ve attached our brand to multiple film festivals where you have to submit multiple times. When you submit your film to Cinebur, your film has the chance to be screened by multiple venues in our host network around the world. We think there is a fundamental difference between watching films vs. going there. The moviegoing experience is an integral part of cinema. That‘s why if your film is selected, it is guaranteed at least one physical screening to a live audience that wants to see your film., Why you should submit:, We have revived the short film format by playing short films at the start of the screening, like Carolina Markowiczs‘s Cannes-winning “The Orphan“ or Konstantinos Samaras‘s Drama-winning “Three Eggholders, Almost Four“ which are both on Cinebur. And for longer-form work, like your features, we may offer complete distribution on Cinebur, so our audiences pay to go watch your film‘s screenings - which you get a cut from. That‘s right: we will pay you royalties from earnings you get on the box office., That‘s why Cinebur is more than a film festival. On Cinebur, you have the chance to distribute your film directly to live audiences, so they can experience your film in a cinematic setting. This is the future of cinema, especially during these difficult times when cinemas remain closed and film festivals resort to online screenings, whatever that means., On Cinebur, we aim to preserve the sanctity of cinema and the moviegoing experience. That‘s the cinema revolution, and Cinebur is where that revolution starts., We see the vision. We hope you do too."

        about: "Welcome to NYLIFF., 2020 is almost over and we are hopeful this awful pandemic will be behind us soon. With that, and following the incredible success of our 2020 festival - yes you read that right - we wanted to share the following article from The Long Island Press and let you know we are moving forward with even bigger plans to present your films in 2021!, We DID IT! The second year two-day New York Long Island Film Festival which debuted Nov. 2019 at Seaford Cinemas returned on October 23 and 24 in 2020 at the Lindenhurst Moose Lodge in front of a live sold out crowd! Festival creator and Director Gerry Ferretti refused to follow suit as one by one film festivals went virtual, drive-in or shut down completely. Ferretti was committed to giving the filmmakers and their teams the opportunity to show their films, receive feedback and audience reaction and network with other creative minds and talents. Hearing a laugh in the right spot, hearing the audience reaction is pertinent to getting a film to be the best it can be just like a play on opening night. As a filmmaker and actor Ferretti and his team understand this. As Program Director, film judge and actress Katie Schrader stated, we felt the frustrations of the filmmaker and the performers in getting their work seen in 2020 and wanted to do something to safely change that”. Following all New York State social distancing guidelines and requiring face masks, the festival moved forward and became the first and only festival in New York to screen films in front of a live audience IN PERSON on a screen “just like movies are supposed to be seen“ said Ferretti. With chairs spaced out 6 feet apart the audiences came and went for the various 3-6 film blocks throughout the days and nights. “This is a fantastic festival…so happy to be a part of it” said “Stray Dogs” actor Skyler Pinkerton who traveled from California to Lindenhurst for the festival. Patrick Devaney, director of “Identity Check” said “ our film has been accepted into 26 festivals in 2020, yet NYLIFF was the FIRST opportunity we had to show it in front of a live audience!” Committed to a diverse platform and billing itself as the “festival for everyone” NYLIFF continued to be open to all genres, budgets and subject matter. Returning filmmaker Phil Snyder may have said it best. “The folks at NYLIFF not only pulled this off under adversity… but the team proved for a second year in a row much they care about the filmmakers and their work.”, And Daryl Denner – Director of “Unspoken” said the folks at NYLIFF “made me feel like a part of a family and not just some stranger”, With even bigger plans for 2021 NYLIFF will be continuing at the Lindenhurst Moose Lodge as well as moving additional films into another nearby location. The festival will be held on October 21-24, 2020, The New York Long Island Film Festival. The festival that was created for EVERYONE! Our goal continues to be to give equal opportunity to ALL filmmakers, writers and artists who put their HEART and SOUL into their craft, especially those who may not have all the resources necessary to perfectly polish their work! Artists in the past were discovered for their unique talents and abilities even if all the technical aspects were not in place. Recognizing a great story, actor, script or any other artist while not yet perfected should be the job of those doing the evaluating. Whether you have a 10 million dollar indie or an ultra low-budget iphone short, we are interested in you. Think of us as the SUN Studios of Film Festivals! (Google it), Now heading strongly into our third year, our growing team brings years of experience as writers, actors, musicians and of course filmmakers, dedicated to bringing the greatest talents to our big screens as well as discovering those hidden geniuses and gems out there. It is this standard of excellence and commitment we hope will establish us as the most innovative, all-inclusive festival in the New York area for years to come., The festival will take place in Lindenhurst New York, on Long Island - less than an hour from Manhattan, with ease of travel by car or train., We will be presenting Q & A with filmmakers, actors and business people and encourage networking, filmmakers young and old and brain-storming. We will be posting updates throughout the year on all the new developments we are preparing for 2021!"

        about: "Entries are extended for Bewitched, *************************, Call for submissions, BEWITCHED, Animated short films on the theme of witchcraft and ritual, DEADLINE EXTENDED to June 8, 2018 (by midnight), The Toronto Animated Image Society seeks submissions for Bewitched, a touring programme of animated short films that focus on the potential for a decolonial future through the practice of witchcraft and ritual., __________________________________________________________________, First screening is scheduled for February 2019 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Subsequent touring dates TBA. All artists/filmmakers selected will receive an artist fee for each screening. There is a $1.00 USD fee to submit (approx. $1.30 CDN)., __________________________________________________________________, This project is premised on the idea that within the current global political and sociocultural climate there is a stronger presence of occult practices in everyday conversations and the media. Bewitched aims to delve into the politics of the occult and the role it plays in the process of healing and decolonizing one‘s mind and body., Crystal healing, cleansing rituals, Reiki, witchcraft, and other practices have risen in popularity. Guest curator Geneviève Wallen is seeking animated works that address, directly or indirectly, how these practices allow for spiritual connections and reclaiming ancestral gifts. Wallen is especially interested in exploring how the occult and magical practices function outside of colonial histories, and tap into ancestral knowledge., Historically, witchcraft and healing rituals have helped to sustain communities and fight against oppression. The spiritual impacts of these activities offer agency to those seeking cultural reclamation and reconciliation across a wide spectrum of oppressed communities. The practices are also tools for self-love and empowerment, and source of communal sustenance., This call prioritizes artists that are Indigenous, Black, persons of colour, cis women, gender diverse people, LGBTQ2+, people with disabilities, or from other underserved communities. TAIS recognizes that all individuals are intersectional., ABOUT THE CURATOR, Geneviève Wallen is a Toronto-based independent curator and writer interested in issues of ethnocultural representational spaces in Canada. Wallen‘s focus on diasporic narratives, intersectional feminism, intergenerational healing, and alternative BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) futurities inform her practice. She is a curator and board member at Younger than Beyoncé Gallery, and programming coordinator at Xpace Cultural Centre., ABOUT TAIS, Founded in 1984, the Toronto Animated Image Society (TAIS) initially began as a group for animators and animation enthusiasts to connect and share in an art form they love., Over 33 years, TAIS has evolved into an artist-run media arts production centre with a growing membership that supports animation production, presentation, and skills development., As a production centre, TAIS supports creation by our members and guest artists. We commission new animation through special projects and residency programs, present curated programs of animation art by artists from Toronto, across Canada, and around the world, and each year we invite guest artists to screen their work, give lectures, and teach workshops., TAIS prioritizes the involvement of artists from diverse practices, backgrounds, and communities. As part of our commitment to reaching new audiences for animation, we have presented over a dozen projects of community engagement by artists in the last 15 years. Today and into the future, TAIS seeks to present and support work by artists who reflect upon and investigate artistic (social, political, and creative) concerns and prioritize experimental production techniques inherent to contemporary forms of animated art making., Visit us online at www.tais.ca"

        about: "FILMFESTIVAL KITZBUEHEL (August 23 - 29, 2021), Set in the heart of the alps, FFKB aims to address filmmakers, industry professionals, as well as people interested in film and cinema - locally, nationally and internationally. The festival focuses on establishing a connection between the contemporary art of film and the existing traditions of the region. In 2016, FFKB was added to the list of film festivals accredited by the International Federation of Film Producers Associations (FIAPF) and thus has affirmed its young but nevertheless strong standing in the landscape of international festivals ever since. FFKB was accredited by FIAPF as a competitive feature film festival specialized in young directors’ films., FFKB puts its focus on supporting and promoting national and international up and coming talents, giving them the opportunity to present their films to a wide audience, including representatives of the industry and media, in order for them to be seen, discussed and promoted. Furthermore, it is our goal to provide insights for the residents and visitors of Kitzbuehel - not just through screening the “young“ voices of cinema, but also by introducing them to the history of film through our “Retrospective“ section. Through its stimulating, diverse and varied festival program, FFKB has established a fresh, annual, not-to-be-missed summer event in the town of Kitzbuehel."

For six years now, visitors from all over the world are coming to Kassel to experience a program far off the well-trodden paths and the special atmosphere of the Randfilmfest., Prominent directors and actors, fascinating concerts and performances, a handpicked selection of films and discussions with the audience that only exist at the Randfilmfest!, This year it‘s all about the foundation of our society: the youth, Idealized and demonized, it‘s a place of extremes:, Freedom and repression, high spirits and boredom, self-discovery and loss, violence and tenderness, hope and doubt seem to be irreconcilable. This creates the power of rebellion. Without the burden of responsibility, young people set the impulse to untangle the world. Failure allowed and trying out as only duty. The freedom of youth is inviolable and yet endangered by the conditions of the world., In its seventh edition, the Randfilmfest 2020 is looking for the “Gold of Youth“, which promises the richness of the moment with a shimmering illusion, but also places the whole weight of the future on narrow shoulders., For the first time the border film festival takes place in the Bali-Kinos at the Kulturbahnhof Kassel. Well-kept cinema atmosphere and a full program of films, discussions with the audience, music and dance performances bring the disturbance closer to the center of Kassel!"

Poderão consultar aqui um Exemplo de Feedback no tipo de serviço que será prestado., (como já é do vosso conhecimento, as candidaturas que requisitem este serviço de FEEDBACK não terão qualquer tipo de benefício no tipo de avaliação prestada pelo painel avaliador do GUIÕES, tendo em vista a selecção para o lote de finalistas, mas poderá ser uma ferramenta muito útil para o desenvolvimento do guião a curto/médio prazo; todos os guiões submetidos a concurso serão avaliados com o mesmo rigor de forma justa e imparcial – características que se têm afirmado como a principal bandeira e força motriz do GUIÕES), **RECOMENDAMOS A LEITURA ATENTA DO REGULAMENTO EM WWW.GUIOES.COM/REGULAMENTO ANTES DE SUBMETER QUALQUER CANDIDATURA**, PRAZOS E TAXAS DE INSCRIÇÃO, COMPETIÇÕES LONGAS E PILOTOS DE SÉRIES, Regular (até 30 de Novembro 2020) = 30€, Regular com Feedback (até 30 de Novembro 2020) = 130€, Estendida (até 31 de Janeiro 2021) = 60€, Estendida com Feedback (até 31 de Janeiro 2021) = 160€, PT CO-PROD e PT IN PROGRESS, Prazo Único (até 31 de Março 2021) = 25€, Para o PT CO-PROD deverá apresentar o projecto completo: incluindo sinopse, biofilmografia da equipa envolvida, orçamento, plano de financiamento, moodboard;, Para o PT IN PROGRESS deverá apresentar um vídeo-pitch até 5 minutos com imagens do filme + informações gerais do projeto (como sinopse, biofilmografia da equipa, calendário de finalização, plano de financiamento), MÉTODOS DE PAGAMENTO, A candidatura via FilmFreeway apenas permite pagamento da correspondente taxa de inscrição via Paypal ou Cartão de Crédito (Visa, Mastercard)., CONCEITO, O GUIÕES nasceu em 2014 para ajudar a resolver três problemas:, 1. Os baixos índices de criação e de produção cinematográfica em Língua Portuguesa (considerando que se trata da 5ª língua mais falada no mundo);, 2. A dificuldade que talentosos guionistas/roteiristas de Língua Portuguesa encontram para conseguir chegar a agentes, produtores, realizadores e investidores;, 3. As queixas que agentes, produtores, realizadores e investidores fazem da dificuldade em arranjar guiões/roteiros com potencial, quando normalmente eles próprios não aceitam/lêem submissões de guiões/roteiros não solicitados., Posto isto, é principal objectivo do GUIÕES estabelecer-se anualmente como um essencial ponto de contacto entre os guionistas/roteiristas/criadores cinematográficos de Língua Portuguesa e os produtores, realizadores, distribuidores e demais profissionais que poderão dar sequência ao material criado., Empregando esforços diversos na conexão do polo criativo que deriva do festival com decision-makers e profissionais da indústria internacional, o GUIÕES afirma-se cada vez mais como uma incontornável janela do cinema e do audiovisual em Língua Portuguesa para o mundo."

We don‘t go prospecting for films at other festivals and give every film the same fair chance. We don‘t look at the festival screening history of the submitted films or the previous works of the directors. Everyone starts with a blank slate and we only judge the films based on their own merits., Waivers are only given to filmmakers that were previously selected at the festival., Directors selected for competition are invited and receive travel (depending on the country of origin), three nights of hotel, meals and accreditation for the complete festival. Films outside of competition are payed a screening fee, or can request accommodation (places are limited), meals and accreditation at the festival., All selected directors receive fee waivers for next editions of the festival., The festival‘s focus on directors makes it a great place to get to know colleagues and present your film to the broad audience present in Leuven."

        about: "For already the second time the Medienkolleg Innsbruck organizes the TakeOne Filmfestival. Until january fourth 2019, film makers of all ages are invited to convert their thoughts and ideas for „Typical Tyrol?!“ into a short movie of max. 6 minutes. Because it’s a very wide topic, creativity and originality in every sense are required. From documentaries, over full of action adventure movies, to society critical approaches – everything is allowed. On the evening itself, the best submissions in each category (students until the age of 18 and everybody above) are shown on big screen in the ForumRum and are promised to take home special prices and in the best case even the TakeOne trophy. Besides the film competition there will be a talk around with several experts from different sectors in the media branche. They’ll discuss the pros and cons of Tirol as a media landscape and will each give their own perspectives and experiences. After the award show our DJ will invite you to the aftershow party . Safe the date and be there when we will honor Tyrols best filmmakers!"

The Filmmaker and HRAFF agree that these T & C form the entire agreement in relation to the Film submitted by the Filmmaker to HRAFF., 8. This agreement will be governed by the laws of Victoria., A few tips & FAQs for Filmmakers thinking of submitting to HRAFF., What is a human rights film?, A Human Rights film is premised on the concept that we all share a universal humanity that is inherently worthy of dignity and respect. It does not necessarily need to address a particular right or convention nor does it necessarily need to be legalistic, Some examples of what we consider “human rights films” are those that:, • Celebrate what it is to be human;, • Tell those stories that relate to the basic rights of all people;, • Uncover and explore human rights violations;, • Explore and challenge concepts of discrimination or persecution;, • Portray marginalized individuals or communities;, • Invite audiences to engage with previously unfamiliar social justice issues, or provide fresh perspectives on social justice issues; and, • Challenge pre-conceptions of what human rights are or should be., What exactly is HRAFF looking for?, HRAFF is looking for diverse, innovative and creative responses to human rights. We want films that inspire and engage audiences. In particular, HRAFF is seeking films that creatively and artistically engage with the field of human rights and explore the complexities of human existence in the context of political and social structures. It is also important that the films are accessible to a festival going audience and have a high degree of technical excellence., This year we have 4 primary programming streams, and films that fall within these categories have a better chance of being selected. These categories are:, Indigenous Rights, Conflict & The Global Movement of People, Gender Equality, The Rights of People with Disabilities, However we also will consider any human rights films that fall outside these streams., Is there a particular genre that we won’t accept?, No! Films of any genre may be accepted, from documentary, narrative, animation, music video, essay film, comedy, horror, sci-fi, adventure and experimental. We love to watch films that take a fresh and creative approach to human rights., Are there particular kinds of content that you won’t screen or that you’re less likely to screen?, Our audience is intelligent and film-literate. We are less likely to screen films that are didactic and simplistic., Films that feature content including racist, pornographic, defamatory, obscene, hateful, discriminatory behaviour or other acts or thematic material considered to be both extreme and gratuitous will not be programmed., We screen films on the big screen, not the small screen. Films that are made for, or are considered more suitable for news and current affairs television programming, online content or similar are generally not included., Similarly, films that are not cinematic or have very low production values may not be included. Films that exist primarily to promote or market a particular NGO or organisation will not be screened. The presence of a particular organisation within the context of the content is, however, acceptable., Films that have had significant exposure in Australia (through film festivals, television, cinema, DVD release or online availability) are less likely to be selected., What about duration? Can I submit long format or feature material, or are we only talking shorts here?, Films of any duration may be submitted. However, we do not accept series. Films received that are 30 minutes or under in length are considered for short film session programming. Films with a duration extending over 30 minutes will be considered for the features program., What should I know before submitting a film to HRAFF?, Before submitting your film to our Festival, you should make sure you read and understand HRAFF’s Terms and Conditions. These Terms and Conditions outline all of HRAFF’s conditions of entry and legal issues relating to you submitting the film. These are available on the website. When you submit your online submission application, we will ask you to confirm that you agree to these terms and conditions., By submitting a film to HRAFF, am I assigning ownership to the Festival? Or does it mean that I can’t submit my work for screening anywhere else?, When you submit your film to the HRAFF, you are granting HRAFF a non-exclusive licence to screen your film to the public at our Festival as well as at other events we organise, such as schools screenings, conferences and fundraisers., A non-exclusive licence basically means that you are giving us permission to screen your film at our Festival and these events. There are no restrictions on your ability to submit your work to any other festival or to do anything else with the film. You retain absolute ownership of your film., Our right to screen your film at other HRAFF events ends 24 months after the Festival at which your film is screened. However, as a courtesy, we will notify you beforehand of any additional screenings during that time., Does HRAFF have any other rights to use our film?, By submitting a film to HRAFF, you also grant HRAFF a licence to screen any part of your film for promotional and marketing purposes. This may include taking excerpts of the film to make a trailer, using still images for our program and making a copy of the film for judges or speakers., Here’s a few things we can’t do: HRAFF can’t pass on, or give rights to other organisations to screen your film without your permission. HRAFF can’t use more than 3 minutes of your film for promotional purposes and HRAFF can’t directly make money from screening your film in a context outside the festival., What else do I have to do before submitting a film?, When you submit a film, you’re saying that you have the authority to give us a licence to screen the film and that you have obtained all the necessary permissions and consents from the people who may have rights in elements of the film. Before submitting your film, you will need to make sure that you have written permission to, for example, use all the music that features in your film., I am under 18. Can I still submit my film to HRAFF?, In order to submit a film to HRAFF, you will need to be over 18. If you are under 18, you will need to get your parent or guardian’s consent to submit the film on your behalf. Consent forms are available for download from the HRAFF website and should be emailed to submissions@hraff.org.au. Please contact us if you have any questions., So, what exactly do you need from me, film-wise?, HRAFF prefers submitted films to be a secure online screener or DVD. You need to be responsible for making sure your film has undergone the relevant technical and quality checking before submitting. This should include – checking for digital glitching, artefacting, audio peaking, loss of vision or sound, sound syncing issues or any issues around the way the disc you’re giving us actually works. The video in the disc should be of a high quality in encoding – this means that it does not appear compressed, blocky or difficult to view on the final submission disc that you’re giving us. Please also ensure what you’re giving us is free of scratches fingerprints, and please ensure that your disc is labelled with the title of the film, the duration, and your name and contact details., We also prefer for all submissions to have prepared an official synopsis, a director bio and photo. If your film is selected we will ask for a press release. We like to run publicity on the festival with minimum 3 months notice and this expedites the process., When you’re submitting your work to HRAFF, you’re doing so at your own risk – we can’t be responsible for loss, delay of delivery or any damage to the material that is received. Where we find that there are technical issues with your film, and it’s something we need to address in final consideration of the film for the festival, we’ll get in touch with you to provide the opportunity to resubmit, pending available time and circumstance., I still have questions! Who can I contact?, If you have any questions, whether it be about our terms and conditions or submission process or selection criteria, please email us at: submissions@hraff.org.au"

        about: "Trackingb‘s prestigious contests discover and promote writers and have lead to some of the biggest contest success stories in the industry., “I entered my spec script EXTANT in the pilot contest because I‘d heard so much about trackingb and its reputation for helping writers reach the holy grail of representation. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that eight months later I‘d be in production, going straight to series on CBS. I know that‘s a million to one shot, but it happened, and trackingb‘s tv pilot contest was the very first step.“, - Mickey Fisher (contest finalist & now Executive Producer/Creator - “Extant“ & “Reverie“)., “After becoming a finalist, I landed two of the best reps in town and sold my first feature... the trackingb contest was the launching pad.“, - John Swetnam (contest finalist with “Evidence,“ screenwriter of “Step Up: All In,“ “Into The Storm“ & “Breaking Through“), “I‘ve placed in several big screenwriting contests before, but none of them delivered anything close to the results of my Honorable Mention in the Trackingb.com contest. I received over a dozen requests from top representatives and production companies, one of which became my first option. Now Mike (my co-writer) and I just sold a comedy pilot to Spike TV. It all traces directly back to the trackingb contest.“, - Gabriel Snyder - (contest Honorable Mention and now Co-Creator of KIRBY BUCKETS on Disney XD), “The TrackingB contest changed my life as a screenwriter. As a finalist, my script was read by industry professionals all over town, and I ended up signing with an amazing management company (Benderspink). Not only was the exposure great, but I was touched by the personal dedication the TrackingB staff put into answering questions, giving advice, and offering encouragement along the way. There is no question that this competition is the launching point of my career. Can‘t recommend it enough!“, - Ashleigh Powell - Finalist (& Now Sold Screenwriter after selling SOMACELL to Warner Brothers!), “After getting an Honorable Mention I landed my first manager and sold my first feature which ended up getting made! This contest placement was the beginning of my career.“, - Matias Caruso (contest Honorable Mention and now produced screenwriter with Honorable Mention script RAGE that was retitled and became the movie MAYHEM)"

        about: "Westflix is a celebration of the best short films produced by high school students throughout California. The films were historically showcased in an evening screening at the ArcLight Cinemas in Hollywood and followed by a day of workshops with industry professionals at Harvard-Westlake School, the sponsor of Westflix. With the onset of COVID-19, Westflix‘20 occurred online, and the Westflix‘21 team will take a hybrid (socially distant + virtual) approach to festival planning., Now in its 18th year, Westflix (formerly Harvard-Westlake Film Festival) has come a long way since its start. Founded in 2004 by Harvard-Westlake alumna Elizabeth Yale ’04, the first festival showcased the films in Harvard-Westlake’s Rugby Theater with alum Jake Gyllenhaal as its speaker. In 2008 the venue changed to ArcLight Cinemas in Hollywood to accommodate the festival’s expanding audience. The festival continues to expand each year under new student leadership and faculty advisors Jesse Chehak, Reb L Limerick and Ted Walch., Westflix serves as a premium showcase for high school filmmakers throughout California. Films are selected by a committee of students, teachers and industry professionals who view the entries and choose the finalists. A judging panel of industry professionals chooses winners in many different categories. Previous judges include Peter Gallagher, Kevin Costner, Sarah Timberman, Alfre Woodard, and Yvette Lee Bowser., Each year, the festival evening features a keynote speaker who is chosen to talk about their career and success in the film industry. Throughout the years, we have had the privilege of hosting, among others, Tom Hanks, Jamie Lee Curtis ’76, Paul Thomas Anderson, Kathryn Bigelow, Guillermo del Toro, Jason Reitman ’95, Aaron Sorkin, Allejandro Inarritu, Edgar Wright, Spike Jonze, Michael Sheen and Kate Beckinsale, and Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton., The 2011 festival began a new tradition. On Saturday, following the annual screening, Harvard-Westlake plays host to all of the festival filmmakers and their crews for a day of conversation with each other and workshops with film professionals., To learn more about the history of the festival and watch previous award-winning student films, visit hw.com/Westflix."

The Festival hosts multiple competitions focused specifically on early-career filmmakers, in the hopes of bolstering their work at an important juncture and helping develop a discussion around their films, both within the film community and beyond. With prizes of cash & in kind goods and services valued at more than $130,000, HIFF continues to support the artists that create some of the best films each year.

It draws people from far and wide with a mixture of films, performances, contraptions and surprises, and has been described as “magnificently eclectic” (Time Out), “joyously inventive” (the Guardian) and “the UK’s most creatively curated film festival” (the Independent)., The kind of work we put on depends upon the project, but recurring themes include animation, music, artists’ film, archive discoveries, offbeat shorts for kids and live cinema. We are firm believers in creating a sense of occasion, exploring the fertile territory where film bumps up against other artforms, and showing people things they might not otherwise have seen."

        nameInternational: "Festival of (In)appropriation"
        about: "Whether you call it collage, compilation, found footage, détournement, or recycled cinema, the incorporation of already existing media into new artworks is a practice that generates novel juxtapositions and new meanings and ideas, often in ways entirely unrelated to the intentions of the original makers. Such new works are, in other words, “inappropriate.” This act of (in)appropriation may even produce revelations about the relationship between past and present, here and there, intention and subversion, artist and critic, not to mention the “producer“ and “consumer“ of visual culture itself. Fortunately for our purposes, the past decade has witnessed the emergence of a wealth of new audiovisual elements available for appropriation into new works. In addition to official state and commercial archives, resources like vernacular collections, home movie repositories, and digital archives now also provide fascinating material to repurpose in ways that lend it new meaning and resonance., Founded in 2009, the Festival of (In)appropriation is a yearly showcase of contemporary, short (20 minutes or less), audiovisual works that appropriate existing film, video, or other media and repurpose it in “inappropriate” and inventive ways. The show is curated by Jaimie Baron, Lauren Berliner, and Greg Cohen."

To achieve this dual objective in a context of security and health crisis, added to a new communication paradigm in the digital era, a new management momentum is required., both in terms of event content redefinition and development of an appropriate strategy. \nThe Festival is a biennial event taking place in Ouagadougou, capital of Burkina Faso. Initially scheduled to take place in February 2021, the 27th Edition has been rescheduled from 16 to 23 October 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFESPACO 2021 is part of the imperative need to continue the beautiful and unique artistic and human adventure Burkina Faso has been striving to offer the world without discontinuing, for more than 50 years now, irrespective of political changes.\nIn keeping with this tradition and to trigger the new momentum, the current Delegate general, Alex Moussa SAWADOGO, spelt out his vision for FESPACO in his speech as he took office in October 2021. The 2021 Edition artistic project includes three main separate but complementary segments. The project content articulates around the Artistic sections, Fespaco Pro and Specific events. The strategy consists in identifying venues and locations for the 27th edition, mobilizing work teams and revitalizing the African Film Library of Ouagadougou.\n"

Cine-Excess hosts UK theatrical premieres and exclusive screenings, visiting international filmmakers, a 3 day themed conference and media mentoring sessions for young filmmakers. From 2007 onwards, Cine-Excess has generated a number of ancillary activities which have included a DVD label, a documentary film production arm, and an online film journal., Cine-Excess has a strong tradition of attracting global cult filmmakers as guests to the event, who attend as recipients of the annual Cine-Excess Lifetime Achievement Award. Some of the previous filmmaking guests of honour to have attended Cine-Excess include Jen and Sylvia Soska, Catherine Breillat, Roger Corman, Dario Argento, Joe Dante, Vanessa Redgrave, Sergio Martino, Franco Nero, John Landis, Enzo G. Castellari, Brian Yuzna, Ruggero Deodato, Victoria Price, Stuart Gordon, Jeff Lieberman, Pete Walker, Norman J. Warren and Jake West., Cine-Excess has previously been based in London’s West End and in the city of Brighton, but has been firmly established in the West Midlands since 2016, where it now part of the film festival calendar for the region. The annual event therefore takes place at a number of associated cinemas and screening venues during the duration of the event., In terms of its programming strategy, Cine-Excess hosts a range of UK theatrical premieres and exclusive retrospective screenings from around the world, but with a strong focus on the following global territories: Europe, North America/Canada, Central America, Asia and Australia. The festival also retains a wide definition of cult film that encompasses a broad range of horror cycles, unconventional thrillers, revisionist or hybrid genres (such as science fiction, gangster cinema, dark love dramas or the western), action cycles or fantastic titles that can also be linked to wider national film traditions."

We consider anything under 40 minutes a short and over that length a feature., How long until I hear back?, Once submitted, the Directors Notes curation team will respond to your submission within 7 days., What if my film is already online?, Not a problem. Directors Notes doesn’t require exclusivity or premiere status to feature your film, although we do give priority to our premiere releases., Can I submit my unreleased film?, Of course, be sure to include the password in the submissions form so we can watch it., My film is still on its festival run and not ready for an online release yet, do I have to wait until it is to submit?, Not at all, we regularly run features for films on the festival circuit and not yet available online., Will a Directors Notes feature earn me a Vimeo Staff Pick?, Whilst many of the films we’ve featured have donned that most coveted of badges, there is no guaranteed route from a Directors Notes feature to a Vimeo Staff Pick. However, as discussed in our How to Get a Vimeo Staff Pick interview, we do know that DN is one of the sites the Staff Pick team regularly check in on when hunting for films so fingers crossed!, Can I get a refund?, The submission fee covers the process of the Directors Notes curation team assessing your film and is therefore non-refundable., Will you definitely feature my film?, Of the thousands of films submitted to Directors Notes, only a small percentage make it to our pages. We’re very selective about the work we choose to feature – it’s what makes DN what it is – and so submission in no way guarantees coverage., If selected, when will my film be featured?, Once selected, we will work with you to find the best date to feature your film on Directors Notes. We have a very busy editorial calendar here at DN so if you have a particular date in mind the more notice you can provide, the higher the likelihood of that publication date being available., How will Directors Notes promote my work?, As well as being featured on Directors Notes, your film will be added to the WeAreDN Vimeo channel, our weekly newsletter and shared across our social media accounts (Facebook, Twitter & Instagram). We also suggest that you do the same across your accounts and get cast, crew, friends and family to pitch in spreading the word too., Can I get feedback?, Sorry, at this point in time Directors Notes does not offer a feedback service for submissions., Do you grant fee waivers?, No, we do not offer submission fee waivers."

        about: "Cinema Perpetuum Mobile 2018 Manifesto, In the consumerist society, the festival is considered to be a commodity or a serving institution. The evidence of this is a great number of festivals of cheese, sausages, beer, smoked meats and rodents, springing up like mushrooms after the rain. The main function of an ordinary festival is to produce entertainment and happiness. Festival turns into building of the citadel of hedonism. Entertainment, happiness and hedonism are perceived as legitimization of consumption and dominant idea of commodity. We live in the epoch of Neo-Hellinism, when circuses once again become the ideological basis for the absolute authority and, in our case, economic system., Belarusian cinemagoers, as members of the consumerist society, assess the quality of a commodity, voting with a ruble. Now we can see the results of this vote – the audience is getting bored at the cinema. They no longer feel happy to encounter the sublime on the screen and find no savour left in the magic of a cinema hall. Disappointed and frustrated, they try to find their happiness in other places. Standing in a queue to the unemployment centre, going to the sale of household goods at the department store or a local job fair – those and other ‘festivals’ of our age deprive us, the true representatives of the festival movement, of well-deserved laurels and reverence., However, we are not afraid of hardships and ready to sacrifice the most precious for the sake of people‘s happiness. Let the hamster wheel of our perpetuum mobile machine fall on its side and turn into something that fully corresponds to the people’s aspirations and ideas of the sublime – into the circus ring. And the bedsheet we used to project films gets distorted under the pressure of market demands and turns into a chapiteau tent., Let the famous acrobats impress us with their tricks and the lions trained by some famous tamers demonstrate their surprising sense of duty and gentle character. Everything is made for your pleasure: transgender midgets, muscular clowns, and an old bear with an accordion. We live in the era of the circus society and this show must go on. So you are welcome to take your seats, relax and sink into the world of happiness. Happiness that is honest and truthful! Happiness that fits our pathetic postmodern reality!, Let’s feed Achilles with turtle soup! Belarusian draniki will be the second course and kompot by Cinema Perpetuum Mobile the third! Here it is, pleasure for the eye. Here it is, our last performance!, DIY OR DIE!, ***, Cinema Perpetuum Mobile is an international short film festival founded in 2011 in Minsk, Belarus. Our focus is on short film cinematography of all genres and topics., From the very start, our goals have been to promote human values and cover crucial social problems through independent cinematography. Besides that, we search for new forms of cinema art and aim at establishing networks and cultural dialogue between Belarusian and international filmmakers. Last, but not least, we promote young Belarusian cinematography locally and abroad."

We are looking for stories that capture the imagination, talent, and diversity of independent filmmakers, which will leave audiences in awe., Many filmmakers, specially the first-timers, want to start with unduly ambitious stories. What makes a short film a great film it‘s not how ambitious the story is, but the way the story is being told. The ingredients to have a great short film are a coherent script, outstanding directing, compelling camerawork, exquisite lighting and tight editing. There are a lot of films that are interesting, but have a careless sound. Every film directors must care about the sound before the shooting, it‘s one of the most important cinematic elements. Catch great actors, not models! Stories on screen must be told in a real way, not in a theatricality way."

        about: "CINANIMA is an animation film festival organised by NASCENTE – Cooperative Society with Cultural Purposes, and by the Espinho City Hall. Ever since its first edition, back in 1976, it has been working continuously to promote this form of cinema and its authors. It has been considered a precursor of cultural decentralisation in Portugal, as CINANIMA has won international recognition while not belonging to the main cultural centres of Lisbon or Porto.\n\nThe Festival is organized by a non-profit association, it is approved by ASIFA – Association International du Film d’Animation – and is supported by the Ministry of Culture/ ICA I.P. – Institute of Cinema and Audiovisual, the Ministry of Youth/ Portuguese Institute of Youth, the Portuguese Tourism Institute, the Ministry of Economy and the Parish Council of Espinho. It is also sponsored by several private entities, and has formed partnerships with the media for promotion and advertisement purposes.\n\nTo many professionals, the opportunity to present a film at CINANIMA represents one of the few opportunities to show the public the result of their work and effort, in addition to the privileges to which the winners are entitled. CINANIMA’s Grand Prize winner for short films is placed on the shortlist for the Oscar© for the Best Animation Short film nominations, as the Festival is one of the events recognised by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nThroughout these 45 years of activity, CINANIMA has contributed to creating new audiences for this art form, encouraging the general public to recognize the value of animation cinema, pushing aside the prejudice that animation is only for children and confirming animation as an outstanding artistic and multidisciplinary communication platform.\n\nBesides promoting contact between professionals and the audience, CINANIMA is strongly committed to educating professionals and the general public. In recent years it has been developing an educational programme in the visual arts that also enriches experience of those who visit the Festival.\n\nA festival such as CINANIMA consists of more than just films, it is also composed of numerous exhibitions, workshops, performances and other initiatives that are held during that week. For those who don’t have the time or availability to be at the Festival the whole week, and would prefer to see the best of the competition in one go, Sunday, the last day of the Festival, is surely a good day to come to Espinho and see one of the four screenings dedicated to the winning films. Those familiar with CINANIMA know they won’t be disappointed. If you have never been here before, come and discover the Festival!"

        about: "The Chicago Underground Film Festival, the longest running underground film festival in the world, is an internationally recognized program providing a venue for documentary, experimental and avant-garde narrative film and video. The festival’s mission is to select and screen film, video and related works presenting a diverse line up of moving image programming focusing on filmmakers working to reinvent and explore new approaches to established practices, to foster new forms of media art and to build an audience for such work. Our goal is to achieve these aims by presenting a fun, user-friendly and accessible event..if you suspect your film is “underground,“ it probably is..., “What you get for your money is not just admission to the films but admission to a subculture“ -- Roger Ebert, Founded in 1993, The Chicago Underground Film Festival is dedicated to the work of film and video makers with defiantly independent visions. Unlike many other “independent“ film events our goal is not to imitate old guard, market-driven festivals such as Sundance. Instead we seek to create our own particular niche by presenting an accessible, user-friendly showcase for Avant-Garde and cult cinema. CUFF presents a wide range of work exploring the many definitions and interpretations of the concept of “underground“. From alternative music films and political agitprop to high camp and formal experimentation. We like films that go beyond expectations and genre, films made with passion, obsession and drive., The festival offers a mix of films and videos of all lengths and genres, focusing on work that is experimental in form or content. Panels and workshops augment this diverse programming. Of course, we also present nightly parties (including our infamous “Take The Filmmakers Bowling“ party) as well concerts featuring performances by artists such as Pedestrian Deposit, Brett Nauke, Jeremiah Meece, The Ponys, Bobby Conn & The Glass Gypsies, Plastic Crimewave Sound, The Cheater Slicks, The Demolition Doll Rods, Califone, Frontier, Terre Thaemlitz, The Handsome Family, The Wesley Willis Fiasco, Maureen Tucker, The Gaza Strippers and the Waco Bros., Recent programming highlights include the Chicago premieres of Tony Conrad: Completely In The Present by Tyler Hubby, The Love Witch by Anna Biller, The Alchemist Cookbook by Joel Potrykus, Ruined Heart by Khavn, Blood Below The Skin by Jennifer Reeder, Evaporating Borders by Iva Radivojevic, For The Plasma by Bingham Bryant and Kyle Molzan, Sailing A Sinking Sea by Olivia Wyatt, Speculation Nation by Bill Brown and Sabine Gruffat, Atlantis by Ben Russell, See You Next Tuesday by Drew Tobias, The Color Wheel and Impolex by Alex Ross Perry and American Arab by Usama Alshaibi,, In addition, CUFF has consistently honored the history of underground and independent cinema by presenting tributes and retrospectives of filmmakers such as Tom Palozzolo, Richard Kern, Kenneth Anger, George Kuchar, John Waters, Jack Smith, Paul Morrissey, Melvin Van Peebles, Doris Wishman, Larry Cohen, Alfred Leslie, Nick Zedd and Alejandro Jodorowsky."

The theme of this edition is: FUTUREBODY. The BIO·FICTION festival is looking for films dealing with how neurotechnology shapes the future of the human body, mind, intelligence and society., Topics include but are not limited to :, · Brain-Computer-Interface, · Human Augmentation/Enhancement, · Intelligence Explosion, · Techno-Evolution, · Transcranial direct-current (deep brain) stimulation, · Whole brain emulation, mind upload or brain upload, · Neuro- and sensory prosthesis, · Neuroimplants, · Mindful wearables, · Human brain organoids (mini-brain), · Cyberbilities, · Disability and what it means to be normal, · Neuro-hacking, · Neuro-art, · Neuro-entrepreneurship, The FUTUREBODY project will culminate in the two day long BIO·FICTION Science Art Film Festival, held in Vienna, Austria in September 2019. After the film festival, a selection of the films will tour around the world. BIO·FICTION invites filmmakers, artists, designers, but also hackers and scientists – anyone who likes to delve into the topic - to think creatively about how the use of neurotechnology may affect individuals or society at large., The submitted short films should be up to 15 minutes long and can cover the issue from factual or fictional perspectives, so we accept all submissions spanning from fiction across documentary, animations, and including comedy or experimental genres., During the festival, awards will be awarded in the categories ‘fiction’, ‘documentary’ and ‘animation’. The awards include a prize of €1000 in each category. To submit your film, please fill in the form at https://bio-fiction.com/submissions/ and upload your film via one of the listed websites before July 31st:, - https://filmfreeway.com/, Multiple entries are allowed, and you can submit more than one film to each category or different categories as long as they comply with the guidelines.

The Austrian part is funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) project number I 3752-B27., History of the festival, BIO·FICTION set out in 2011 to pioneer a creative, interdisciplinary and visionary event platform to explore synthetic biology from all possible angles. This is also why we chose to call it the BIO·FICTION Science Art Film Festival. We took a step away from traditional formats and perfected a program that would unite traditional panel discussions, Q&A sessions, art performances, film screenings, and interactive workshops – to name a few., For its second iteration in 2014, we cast our net even bigger and wider: We invited participants (speakers, panelists, artists, workshop instructors etc.) from a wealth of backgrounds, including science and engineering, the social sciences, cultural studies, amateur biology, the military, film making, art and design. We also collaborated with the DIYBio Europe network to support participants coming to Biocommons, an event held after BIO·FICTION. The participants that were able to join the festival set up interactive Do-it-Yourself Biology workshop tables, highlighting DIYBio/biohacking groups and their projects., Concurrently, we organized an international short film competition and screened it as part of our festival. The participating films introduced documentaries, animations and fiction shorts that explored synthetic biology and its thematics from every imaginable angle. Have a look at the award winning films for 2011 and 2014!, The feedback from our artists, filmmakers, scientists, students, designers, and registered as well as casual guests was outstanding!, For our upcoming edition of the festival, which will take place in 2019 in Vienna, we’re setting a new focus on neurotechnologies and synthetic biology. Much like our prior editions, we’re going to cut across thematic boundaries, across all disciplines host many exciting events and set up a rich festival program that defies imagination!, Neurotechnologies and synthetic biology will be our focal points of convergences between: neural networks, the body, machines, ecosystems, organs, cells, genes…"

        about: "The Bristol Radical Film Festival began in 2011 to showcase contemporary and historical works of overtly political filmmaking. Our volunteer-run, zero-budget festival promotes and screens both classic and newly-released films that seek to disrupt, deconstruct, and divert from the mainstream., At our events, films are a pretext for action and debate as much as they are important aesthetic and cultural objects in themselves. We always have a discussion or Q&A after our screenings, as we know that the films we screen are part of larger cultural movements that audiences engage with, rather than simply objects of consumption., Our interpretation of the word ‘radical’ is an open one: while we believe that radical social, economic & political change is needed for a more equal, just & sustainable society, that fundamental belief can be articulated in a variety of ways. Film is a rich medium and we are very keen to exhibit works that interrogate political and aesthetic radicalism using new and challenging techniques., We want to maintain the opportunity for full participation with minimal financial barriers. Submission has been free until last year - and out of necessity, we have had to charge a low entry fee. However, since this means we do not have the finances to hire staff to work through hundreds of submissions, we ask that entrants read and take seriously our submission guidelines., Please note: we will not consider films that do not fit our remit. *READ THE BELOW DESCRIPTION FOR ELIGIBILITY GUIDELINES.* If your film is not relevant to our remit, it will not be acknowledged., We look forward to another year of progression, disruption and celebration!"

Webfest Berlin is no exception. After much deliberation and with a very heavy heart I must announce that we have decided to cancel the Webfest Berlin event for 2020. We will continue with our monthly online selections, promotions, and awards, and all awards which would have been given at the festival will be announced online in November., New Year, New Decade, New Webfest Berlin!, After 5 editions of presenting, recognizing, and advancing international short form series, we’ve learned a lot here at Webfest Berlin. We’ve learned about the evolution of the market, what makes successful shows, and how we can best support and expose incredibly talented creators and their shows. So, for our 6th edition, we’re putting our lessons into action and launching a serious upgrade of Webfest Berlin in 2020., One of the most incongruous aspects of a ‘Webfest’ is that we promote creations for the web, ‘IRL’. But our selections deserve a bigger push in their native home than 1 social media post leading up to the festival and a show name posted on our website or newsletter. Our new concept gives MUCH more online promotion to our selections by focusing on the selections of each category for an entire month. That’s right, each month from May to October, a different category’s selections will be announced, promoted, discussed, reviewed, and judged. Then, at the end of the month the category’s award winner is announced!, What does that mean for Webfest Berlin selections? More views, more fans, and more opportunities to engage with the general audience, buyers, distributors, and talent scouts., What does that mean for the general audience, buyers, distributors and talent scouts? Less noise. Every month, a ‘best of the best’ selection in each category will be released. No sorting through lists of shows of all genres. No googling obscure show titles. No sitting through hours of screenings to see that one show you’re curious about. Just direct links to at least one episode of each official selection on our website, in our newsletters, and on our social media channels., Our 2020 theme is #WFBTRENDSETTERS. Each month we’ll highlight series and creators that we believe are setting the trends of the year. Whether it’s writing, pacing, visual technique, genre, time period, or format, we’re just scratching the surface of the possibilities that the web provides for series. As always, we’re keeping a close eye on ‘what’s next’!, Make sure to follow us on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, signup for our newsletter, and submit your series to take part in this exciting new evolution of Webfest Berlin!, Who knows?? Maybe YOU are the #WFBTRENDSETTER who will #BEWHATSNEXT at Webfest Berlin 2020., Find out more about the opportunities that Webfest Berlin offers at www.webfest.berlin"

        about: "BISFF was conceived on an ambitious dream-fuelled evening, and the strength provided by multi-award winner Prakash Belawadi it came to fruition, Prakash who continues to be the festival mentor. The idea of BISFF was to create a platform for young and amateur filmmakers, where they could screen their shorts to discerning audiences and, more importantly, find constructive and critical feedback from experts in the field. In the very first edition of the festival in 2010, there were only a total of 40 short films submitted. This number rose to 3500+ shorts in 2019, where we saw an eclectic mix of Indian and foreign language films. The journey has been a struggle, but a very thrilling and fulfilling one. Today BISFF has the distinction of being one of the largest Short Film Festivals in India. BISFF showcases shorts from across the world, creating a physical space for a great experience of cinema. It brings together keen, like-minded audiences for the filmmakers and also exhibits works by past masters who have dabbled in short filmmaking that today is an independent art form. Additionally, the festival presents talks, panel discussions, demonstrations, and workshops with leading thinkers, professionals, and industry practitioners, providing an opportunity for young filmmakers to interact with the best in the industry.\n\nOSCAR accreditation\n"

        about: "An annual, not for profit, competitive film festival organized to encourage better understanding between people and to make a positive contribution to the art of the moving image. The Chicago International Film Festival is the longest-running competitive film festival in North America. The Festival was started in 1964 by filmmaker and graphic artist Michael Kutza to provide an alternative to the commercial Hollywood movies that dominated the city’s theaters.\n\n\"When we started the Chicago International Film Festival 50 years ago, we had one simple goal: to introduce Chicago and the world to new filmmakers, stories and points of view. We’ve shown first feature films by world-renowned directors like Martin Scorsese (USA), Peter Weir (Australia), Mike Leigh (UK), Gregory Nava (USA), Bertrand Tavernier (France), Jan Troell (Sweden), Joe Swanberg (USA), Tsai Ming-Liang (Taiwan), and Wim Wenders (Germany). Last year we’re proud to say we held fast to that mission by showcasing over 40 films by first-time filmmakers. It’s important to us that we’re always learning, always exploring, always seeing the world in fresh ways\"."

        about: "The short film weekend at Glasgow Film Festival was established in 2008 by short film exhibitor The Magic Lantern, in partnership with the Centre for Contemporary Arts. The event has since grown to become Scotland’s leading competitive short film festival. In 2015 GSFF made a decisive change of date from February to March, finally distinguishing the festival from its 'mother' Glasgow Film Festival.\n\nIn only eight years GSFF has earned an international reputation for quality curation. This is reflected in the increasing numbers of filmmakers, talent spotters and festival programmers who attend each year, from across Europe, North America and Asia. GSFF has been invited to collaborate with festivals and exhibitors in China, Croatia, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and across the UK."

Programming decisions are made at the discretion of the Artistic Director and the programming team.\n\nFeature Film Eligibility\n4. Only UK feature film productions are eligible for open submission – we are not currently accepting open submissions for international feature films. Please skip to point 11 for further information on UK productions.\n5. All feature films screened in the festival must be at minimum UK Premieres. Prior public or advertised UK screenings, theatrical screenings, film festivals, television screenings, internet transmission or DVD releases of feature length films disqualify them from entry. For the Competition sections of the programme, preference will be given to European, International and World premieres.\n6. Exceptions to the UK Premiere rule for feature films may be made for UK Productions but only if:\nThe UK Premiere has taken place in the nation of origin, where a Scottish film has shown once in Scotland, a Northern Irish film in Northern Ireland, or a Welsh film in Wales, in which case the LFF screening must be its second UK screening. This exception does not apply to films originating from England, where the UK Premiere rule applies. This exception does not apply to films selected for Competition and Gala sections. All exceptions are at the discretion of the Artistic Director. The UK Premiere has taken place at BFI Flare: London LGBTIQ+ Film Festival, in which case the LFF screening must be its second UK screening. This exception does not apply to Competition and Gala sections, where the UK Premiere rule applies. Films originating from anywhere in the UK (including England) that premiere at BFI Flare: London LGBTIQ+ Film Festival will remain eligible for LFF consideration, however selection for BFI Flare:\nLondon LGBTIQ+ Film Festival does not automatically guarantee selection at LFF and film representatives must indicate interest in being considered for both Festivals. All exceptions are at the discretion of the Artistic Director.\n7. Entries must have been produced within 12 months prior to the festival start. Films that have screened before the previous BFI London Film Festival (October 2020) at international festivals are ineligible for open submission.\n\nShort Film Eligibility\n8. Short films may be any style or form (eg. narrative, animation, documentary, etc) that have a running time of 40 minutes or less, and have been produced within 12 months prior to the festival start. Films that have screened before the previous BFI London Film Festival (October 2020) at international festivals are ineligible for open submission.\n9. We accept UK and international short film submissions.\n10. There are no premiere or prior screening restrictions for short films. Shorts may have been broadcast on television or the internet, released via any home video outlet, and/or publicly screened anywhere in the world and still remain eligible for consideration by the Festival. While there is no premiere rule for films screening within the main programme, we do prioritise UK, European and World Premieres for our Short Film Competition. UK Productions\n11. A film will be eligible for consideration as a UK feature or short if it has been made by a UK Film Production Company (FPC) which is registered with Companies House, and has been certified as a British film under either:\nThe Cultural Test One of the UK's official bilateral co-production treaties; or\nThe European Convention on Cinematographic Co-production\nYou can find more information on the Cultural Test, and the points-system here:\nhttps://www.bfi.org.uk/apply-british-certification-tax-relief/cultural-test-film\nFor short films, the company does not need to be registered, but the film should be wholly capable of qualifying as a British film, via the Cultural Test. For feature films that have not been produced by a registered UK film production company, if they are primarily selffinanced, entirely shot in the UK and by a British director, these too will be eligible as a UK feature.\nThe IWC Schaffhausen Filmmaker Bursary Award in association with the BFI The IWC Schaffhausen Filmmaker Bursary Award in association with the BFI is a £50.000 award to benefit an outstanding British writer, director, or writer/director whose first or second feature film premieres at the BFI London Film Festival. With a shared goal from both the BFI and IWC to provide more opportunity to underrepresented filmmakers and strive for more inclusion in the industry, for the first time in the Bursary’s history all potential applicants will need their film to meet the BFI Diversity Standards in order to be eligible toapply.\nFor more details, please see www.bfi.org.uk/lff/iwc-schaffhausen-filmmakers-bursaryaward-association-bfi and click through to the FAQs.\nFor clarity, British writers, directors and/or writer/directors holding a UK passport and working and residing in the UK, or currently a formal resident in the UK (having lived or worked here for the last five years) with a first or second feature premiering in the BFI London Film Festival will still be eligible for the IWC Schaffhausen Filmmaker Bursary Award if the film is a non-UK production. Filmmakers which are otherwise eligible and which are entered through open submissions or entered by a sale or distribution partner will have the opportunity to formally submit an application for the Bursary Award once the film is invited to the Festival. Any filmmaker who is otherwise eligible but whose film has not yet been assessed for the Diversity Standards will also have the opportunity to submit it for assessment once the film has been invited to the festival. You do not need to apply before the invitation stage.\n"

        about: "The Concordia Film Festival (CFF) is organized by the student-run, non-profit Cinema Students Association and the Film Animation Students Association of Concordia University. Together, they organize and promote, through screenings and events, the works produced by the diverse range of filmmakers of the Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema (MHSoC). The MHSoC stands as the largest university-based centre for the study of film in Canada, with a body of works that are also screened to great acclaim at festivals around the world., In addition to the programming of films from Concordia Cinema students, the CFF, is proud to present the second edition of VISIONS: a screening that will feature live action and animated films made by women, gender-nonconforming and queer undergraduate students of color. VISIONS seeks to bring together and showcase the art of filmmakers who are vastly underrepresented in the film industry, creating a safe space ripe for discussion and exchange with all attendees., This project began two years ago as a collaboration between Animate Concordia and Yiara Magazine which rose from the growing concern of both student organizations around the question of representation in contemporary visual culture. As a feminist art and art history publication, Yiara actively challenges the dominant and hegemonic sexism that affects the bodies of marginalized individuals. Animate Concordia, the animation Student Association of Concordia University seeks to share the art and rich history of animation, and has strongly recognized the disproportionate number of white/cis/male persons who dominate/control the industry. From this mutual interest and concern arose VISIONS, an event that would bring together our common interests in film and providing a platform for the visibility of projects. While this event wishes to showcase the under-represented filmmakers, we have as our mandate to not exclude or prevent any person from the submission process, in the true inclusive spirit of feminism., The programming of VISIONS will be curated by The Visions Team., The VISIONS submissions are open to all cinema, communications and media students across Canada, who have completed a film within the past year, while in school."

        about: "Truth: Stranger than Fiction, Facts aren’t always facts, and “alternative facts” don‘t always lie., In a world where “truth” is carefully curated, filtered, and viewed through the lens of social media, often the only difference between truth and fiction lies in the perspective through which one views the world., Documentary films offer a fascinating peephole into a particular reality, at a certain time of a certain person‘s life. Whether in the form of an expository, a poem, an essay, an observational piece, whether it‘s dramatized, animated, or based on interviews, documentary films all have a message to send., How can we make a difference in the world?, Documentary films are not just an avenue through which we can observe real life; they also serve to inform, educate, and critique. They are valuable creations in a day and age where media is increasingly curated and so much more homogenous., That is why Doc.Berlin welcomes all of the above forms of documentary film-making, and even more so, those that transcend boundaries to move fluidly between one and more styles., Ours is a new annual film festival featuring work from around the world by up and coming artists, showcasing innovative independent cinema with all selected films inviting viewers to learn and ponder., To inspire, motivate, and award new talent, the Doc.Berlin film festival will take place at the historic Babylon Berlin Cinema, currently the venue for the Berlin International Film Festival (Berlinale)., The Babylon is a cinema in the Mitte neighborhood of Berlin and part of a listed building complex at Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz opposite to the Volksbühne. The building was erected 1928/29 according to plans of architect Hans Poelzig, which is regarded as typical of its construction period, Neue Sachlichkeit., As a celebration of the cinematic and visual arts, the festival will bring diverse international films to our community and showcase the best regional and international filmmakers., Join us at the Babylon on December 14, 15, 16 & 17, 2020."

Panel discussion moderators have included curator and critic Lyle Rexer, and best selling author Mark Alpert., VAEFF 2020 was originally scheduled to run from November 12-14 across several venues in NYC, including the Tribeca Film Center. However this year’s VAEFF screenings will unfortunately be postponed due to COVID-19., While it’s hard to predict what public health guidelines will look like in the coming months, VAEFF is committed to continuing to showcase independent video artists and filmmakers in whatever way it can, and is aiming to have in-person screenings by May 2021.

The organizers of TromaDance believe films are meant to be seen, especially when it comes to new filmmakers.

The official selections of TromaDance have been made with nothing more than passion, courage, integrity, and raw talent., Everyone at TromaDance is treated as an equal. The elite and the celebrated are treated no better or worse than the experimental filmmaker or the random moviegoer off the street. Admittance to all screenings, panels, parties, and events is strictly on a first come, first served basis. If there are any VIPs at TromaDance, they are the filmmakers whose blood, sweat, and hard work are on the screen., TromaDance is an opportunity for everyone who‘s ever picked up a camera to have their work seen without the compromises required by elitist cartel interference. TromaDance is proud to be the first and only film festival of the people, for the people, and by the people., TromaDance Detroit continues this tradition and expands on the possibility of a free and independent festival for the people!

Now in its 38th year, this prestigious fest includes American and foreign dramas, comedies, and documentaries, restored classics, and more. In addition to film screenings, there are Q&As with cast and crew, receptions, and other fun. Now part of the Film Pittsburgh family, the Three Rivers Film Festival will continue its prominent role in bringing our region together to share the power of independent film., The Three Rivers Film Festival typically includes well-attended screenings in beautiful theatrical venues, with film prizes including cash awards, and filmmaker networking events including a filmmakers’ lounge and after parties., While it was our hope to present this year‘s Three Rivers Film Festival in theaters with in-person Q&As and networking opportunities, we are mindful that the Covid-19 pandemic makes that an unnecessarily risky option. Therefore, we are now planning to present this year‘s festival online as a virtual festival like so many others have done. The virtual version of 3RFF will include film screenings, guest filmmaker Q&A‘s as well as virtual networking opportunities. As we‘ve always indicated, the show will go on!"

        about: "The Festival is held annually at the Meighan theatre, the only historic theatre in Pasco County, Florida. The festival provides a venue for local and talented artists to showcase their work in the community with hopes to inspire and advance a greater appreciation for independent film and digital art. The event will help raise awareness of the preservation of historic cinematic landmarks and the cultural identity of New Port Richey., The Thomas Meighan Project / Film Festival is based on the historical past of New Port Richey becoming the next Hollywood. Thomas Meighan was a famous Hollywood silent movie star of the twenties. In 1919, he hit stardom in one of his best known films at the time, The Miracle Man,unfortunately it is now lost in small fragments due to film deterioration. Today, Meighan’s most recognizable role is in the film, Male and Female, directed by one of Hollywood’s legendary directors Cecile B. Demille. Meighan’s popularity continued through the Roaring Twenties with him starring in several pictures. During this time, Meighan visited Florida and fell in love with New Port Richey leading him to build a home and became a resident. The Meighan’s entertained the Hollywood crowd and attracted celebrities to the area. He believed that New Port Richey would be the ideal location for motion picture studios, shortly after representatives of Paramount Pictures came to town to discuss such plans. However, the Great Depression along with the invention of talkies ended his dreams., -Due to time constraints, all entries must not exceed 30 minutes in duration., -Entries must be submitted no later the January 15, 2016 in order to be reviewed & accepted., -Festival selections will be announced Early March 2016."

Thousands of cable and streaming providers are looking for new, fresh content for their programming needs, while fewer and fewer features are being made or acquired., Most festivals still cater largely to feature films, while the market has largely moved on., At “The TV Fest“, we cater exclusively to content meant for the small screen:, - Narrative Pilot episodes, - Factual Television (reality, documentary, game shows, Video podcasts, etc), - Teaser or Pitch videos, - Commercials, - Web Series, - Film Trailers, - Music Videos, - Short films with story potential for further episodes; etc., We will showcase talent regardless of budget, if you have a compelling story to share and a unique voice there is a home for it amongst the thousands of niche providers in the industry., If you don‘t have the budget to make a full-fledged pilot episode/web series with high production values, our shorter form categories let you share your fresh ideas with just a short trailer or teaser!, We will shortlist entries to Official Selections, and then Finalists who are nominated for one of our awards. The festival will screen all finalists as well as a curated selection of the Official Selections. With mostly short form entries and many hours of expected screenings over two days, we expect to be able to screen a large number of entries."

        about: "BANDO DI CONCORSO E REGOLAMENTO, CORTOSORDI III EDIZIONE - ANNO 2016, Il gruppo è formato da operatori culturali, registi, attori e scrittori che si sono ritrovati intorno alla figura del Grande Attore italiano Alberto Sordi pensando di creare un significativo momento di riflessione non solo sulle capacità artistiche dell‘Albertone nazionale, ma soprattutto per valorizzare il suo impegno sociale a favore dei meno abbienti e di chi si trova in stato di sofferenza. Con l‘annuale rassegna “Cortosordi“ il gruppo di lavoro intende far conoscere l‘immensa arte di sordi attraverso la riscrittura filmica di tematiche sociali presenti nei suoi tanti film. Un occhio particolare sarà dato a coloro i quali riusciranno a far rivivere le atmosfere cinematografiche di Sordi sottolineandone gli aspetti ancora vivi nella società odierna. Il gruppo mira a realizzare in tutta Italia un circuito di corti alla memoria di Alberto Sordi. Ciascun componente del gruppo a diverso titolo partecipa a questo progetto con spirito civico e grande amore per il grande cinema italiano e per Sordi troppo in fretta dimenticato ed ancora ignoto al grande pubblico giovanile., L‘appuntamento è fissato per il 23 luglio 2016 a Grottaglie (Taranto)., L‘iniziativa vanta il patrocinio della Fondazione Alberto Sordi (Roma),, ente morale nato nel 1992 proprio per volontà dell‘attore romano, al fine di, promuovere la ricerca scientifica sulle patologie dell‘età avanzata e, l‘assistenza qualificata alle persone anziane, nel rispetto prima e nella, valorizzazione poi della dignità della persona umana e del suo diritto alla, vita e alla salute. L‘evento ha inoltre il patrocinio del Comune di Grottaglie, e della Regione Puglia., REGOLAMENTO, Il concorso “CortoSordi” è una novità nel variegato panorama dei concorsi cinematografici,per partecipare è necessario far pervenire un corto, ad Associazione Utòpia via Ponchielli n°54- 74023 Grottaglie (Taranto) con una tassa di 5 EURO per film inviato, o tramite link all‘indirizzo info@cortosordi.it. Il corto ogni anno si ispirerà ad un film di Sordi. Per il concorso del 2016 il film che dovrà essere preso a pretesto dai registi per realizzare la propria opera è ‘Una vita difficile’, raccontare la società odierna, le difficoltà che spesso mettono a dura prova il rapporto coniugale, il difficile rapporto tra stampa e potere, la situazione dei giornalisti schiavi di chi comanda. Il corto, in formato DVD, dovrà avere una durata massima di 15 minuti. Una giuria qualificata, composta da esperti del settore, visionerà il materiale e selezionerà i cinque corti che arriveranno alle serate del 23 luglio, la data di scadenza per l’invio è fissata al 20 giugno (farà fede il timbro postale). Fra questi verrà conferito il ‘CortoSordi’ al primo, classificato. I corti finalisti inoltre faranno parte nella collezione della, Fondazione Alberto Sordi. Nel corso della serata finale verrà consegnato il, ‘premio alla carriera per il doppiaggio’, in ricordo degli inizi di, Albertone come indimenticabile doppiatore., Per maggiori informazioni sarà possibile contattare la Direzione Artistica, dell‘evento, attraverso l‘indirizzo mail info@cortosordi.it / www.cortosordi.it, o al numero cell. 3883059654."

        nameInternational: "Taiwan International Ethnographic Film Festival"
        address: "Room 2610, Institute of Ethnology, Academia Sinica,  Nankang Taipei 115 Taiwan"
        about: "We are proud to announce the 10th edition of the Taiwan International Ethnographic Film Festival (TIEFF), to be held in Taipei from October 4th to 8th in 2019. Founded in 2001, the biennial festival is Asia’s oldest and longest running international ethnographic film festival. For 18 years TIEFF has served to promote outstanding documentary films from around the world that are innovative, educational, and entertaining. These films, directed by both new and established filmmakers alike, all share a commitment to portraying stories and social practices from around the world in a culturally sensitive way. In addition to the main festival in Taipei, TIEFF also sponsors a touring festival, bringing a portion of the selected films to communities and classrooms across Taiwan the following Spring., TIEFF takes a flexible stance regarding what counts as an “ethnographic” film, including not just works made by anthropologists but also films made by professional filmmakers who display an ethnographic sensibility in their work. That means films which are made in an ethical manner without sensationalizing their subjects. Films that are the product of a long term close collaboration between filmmaker and subject are especially welcome. While we occasionally do accept fiction films, experimental art films, biographies, sports documentaries, and films about musicians, such films will only be considered if they are accompanied by a convincing statement regarding their suitability for the festival. TIEFF is especially proud of its commitment to celebrating the uniqueness and vibrancy of indigenous cultures and has been one of Taiwan’s most important venues for showcasing the work of both local and international indigenous filmmakers. As such we strongly encourage indigenous filmmakers to submit their work to our festival., All films submitted to the festival must have been completed in the two years prior to the festival or on the festival year itself. For this festival that would mean films completed between 2017 and 2019. Films on any topic will be considered, but special consideration will be given to films that match the festival theme (as described below). All festival films go through a highly selective screening process. (In 2017 we selected just 42 films out of 1500 entries.) As such, festival does not have a competition or offer prizes or awards., This year’s theme, “Visions of Sovereignty,” explores our relationships with our land, our bodies, and with each other. Moving beyond traditional political-legal notions of the state, “Visions of Sovereignty” is inspired by the work of indigenous activists and scholars who have called into question the idea that sovereign entities are neatly bounded by clearly marked borders, and that everyone within those boundaries is equally beholden to the state. Instead they ask us to look at sovereignty as a process shaped by how we see our world and our unique place within it. Going back to Hobbes the state has long been thought of as a giant person, with the focus on the body‘s head, occupied by a king or some other ruler. “Visions of Sovereignty” returns our gaze to the stories of the individual men and women who make up the body of the state, showing how they adapt to, challenge, and sometimes even change the very nature of sovereignty., 我們非常驕傲地宣布，第十屆臺灣國際民族誌影展(TIEFF)將於2019年10月4日至8日在臺北舉辦。本影展創始於2001年，是亞洲歷史最悠久的民族誌影片雙年展；18年來，致力於推廣來自世界各國具有創新、教育與娛樂性的民族誌影片。不管是出自名家或新秀之手，這些優秀的民族誌影片都秉持著高度的文化敏感度，描繪來自世界各地的故事與社會實踐。在影展主要活動之外，我們也會在隔年春天進行巡演，將精選影片帶往全臺各地社區和教室播映分享。, TIEFF對於「民族誌影片」採取較廣義的立場。除了人類學家的作品之外，也包含能在影片當中呈現出民族誌敏感度的專業影人作品，意即這些作品的拍攝必須合乎倫理且不煽情。我們尤其歡迎那些與對象長期合作拍攝而成的作品。雖然我們偶爾接受劇情片，實驗藝術影片，傳記、運動紀錄片和有關音樂家的影片，但只有在投片時能說服我們其影片符合本影展的性質，否則這類影片不可能被接受。TIEFF以致力於呈現原住民文化的獨特性和生命力為榮，而且是放映臺灣本土和世界各國原住民影人作品的重要場所之一；因此，我們強烈鼓勵原住民影人向本影展投片。, 所有投片的電影必須是在兩年內或影展舉辦當年完成，意即完成年份必須是2017年至2019年。任何主題的影片皆可，但符合本屆影展主題（如下所述）的影片將有更多機會入選。由於入選影片皆經過選片過程中的高度競爭（以2017年為例，1500部作品當中僅有42部影片入選），因此本影展並無設置競賽獎項。, 本屆影展主題為「看見主權」，主要在探索我們與我們的土地、身體以及彼此之間的關係。根據傳統政治法律對國家的概念，主權實體是被明顯標記的疆界整齊地界定著，而且邊界內的每個人都同樣感激國家；但是，本屆主題受原住民社會運動者和學者作品的啟發，超越上述傳統說法。他們要求我們將主權視為一個過程，而這個過程的塑造取決於我們如何看待我們的世界，以及我們身在其中的獨特地位。回到霍布斯（Thomas Hobbes）的觀點，國家長期以來被視為一個巨人，我們所關注的往往只是位於巨人頭部的國王或其他統治者；「看見主權」使我們的焦點回歸到組成巨人身體的獨立的男人與女人的故事，看他們如何適應，挑戰，甚至改變主權的本質。"

It’s the first of it‘s kind in Ireland, run by the team behind Belfast Film Festival, and chaired by award winning, Internationally renowned documentary film maker, Mark Cousins. Docs Ireland will showcase high quality documentaries that will inspire, educate and enliven cultural discourse., When we at Belfast Film Festival piloted a Irish documentary festival - Pull Focus - in the summer of 2018, we were astounded and delighted as screening after screening sold out. But it makes sense when you realize that documentary is the medium, now more than ever, that helps us make sense of the strange times we are living through. After an brilliantly successful first edition we‘re back in 2020 for round 2!, Docs Ireland will present new and international documentaries, shorts and features, and will host industry events including a marketplace, pitching sessions, masterclasses, new talent focus and funding information events."

        about: "NOTE: This festival is still taking place each week despite the COVID-19 virus. All festival dates have been relegated to private screenings with the same Audience FEEDBACK videos made for the short films, and recorded script readings performed by professional actors for the screenplays., The monthly festival that showcases the best of Thriller/Suspense Genre Stories and Films from around the world., THRILLER festivals occur 4 times a year in Toronto & Los Angeles. Go to the website for information on the next events., Read daily testimonials: https://thrillersuspensefestival.com/?s=testimonial, Submit your film or story and get it showcased at the Festival., Screenplay Festival occurs monthly., - With THRILLER screenplays and films, there will always be a market. This is a genre that will always be popular. Agents and producers are always looking for the next great writer and the next great filmmakers who tell great THRILLER stories. So if that is you, we will showcase your script or short film and make sure the right people see your work., Read recent testimonials of writers/filmmakers works showcased at the Thriller/Suspense Festival:, It was such an amazing experience, the cast and crew love the feedback video and I‘m spreading the word for your festival to as many people as I can. It‘s such an amazing idea. Your statement of “the audience LOVED our film“ is also very touching., - Scott Lyus (Short Film, Silently Within Your Shadow), I was very moved and excited by watching the feedback video. It’s so amazing to see how people react., - Erich Steiner, (Short Film, In the Still of the Night), I truly believe that a table read is the next best thing in seeing my script on the big screen — so I entered my new thriller “The Devil’s Larceny.”, - Howard Fridkin, (Feature Script, The Devil‘s Larceny), I had heard rumors the feedback was genuine, and it did NOT disappoint. It helped me get to what you are about to watch and enjoy!, - Marc W Johnson (Legacy, Feature Film), It was amazing to see the audience interact with the film. As a short filmmaker you rarely get the opportunity to get that much of detailed feedback from an audience. The general statement “It looks beautiful, but what the hell is going on” didn’t come as that much of a surprise as it is similar to reactions we received from other audiences :-) However, I myself enjoy films (or any piece of art for that matter) where there is lots of room for personal interpretation. So it is not that much about the intention of the writer or director, but more about what the audience makes of it for themselves. So in that sense I very much enjoyed the different interpretations and speculations concerning the story., - Daniel Reimer, (Short Film, Bell Tower Enigma), The WILDsound audience could speak freely and honestly and so their impressions were a joy to see. I was also over the moon to see that many in the audience seemed to have grasped and engaged with the main story arc but also with some of the sub-themes of the film. I took a risk by making a film that is somewhat open-ended and one which depends more on visual and musical communication rather than verbal communication. I am delighted to see that, for some in the audience, this paid off., - Don Duncan, (Short Film, A Sign), I‘ve always received insightful notes / a lot of love. You’re our brass ring!, - Monte Light (Little Professor, First Scene Screenpaly), I think I saw the festival highlighted on FilmFreeway, if I remember correctly. I had just finished writing the script and wanted to kind of test the waters to see how it would be received. I’ve directed a number of film projects in the past and I may direct Gravel Heart this fall if I can raise the funds. And I think sending the script out for feedback is important before one spends a lot of time, money, and effort – yours and other peoples’ – shooting a script that isn’t working., - Michael Curtis (Gravel Heart, Short Screenplay), It was absolutely great and exciting (seeing the FEEDBACK Video on my film). Thank you and the audience a lot. I also watched feedbacks of other works that screened. I need to admit that the audience in Toronto is much more film literate, and has a greater sense than most audiences that I have ever seen. The comments and reactions to the film was really nice. Although it was screened in many festivals and events in various countries, that video is the only real feedback that I got from an audience except in my country and except from people working for festivals. It was great too see that the film is still meaningful, fun to watch and has a real reflection in different countries., - Kagan Kerimoglu (The Wheel of Time, Short Film), I always thought that once a film is finished (or abandoned, as someone said once…), it no longer belongs to the filmmakers – it belongs to the audience. This festival is the perfect illustration of that. I very much appreciate the fact that your audience took the time to watch MEDIATION in the first place, and then chose to stay after the screening to discuss it. As a writer-director, I couldn’t ask for more – if there is an audience that cares enough to talk about a film I wrote and directed, then I’ve done my job., - Francisco Lorite (Mediation Short Film)"

        about: "Horrors4You is a film, TV and script competition dedicated to the horror genre. With competitions running four times a year, a changing judge panel of film critics, actors and filmmakers working within the industry, we dedicate ourselves to awarding films based on their originality and creativity, whilst considering their budget restrictions., Taking a page out of our previously successful enterprise - our sister company: TMBT Film Awards (The Monkey Bread Tree Film Awards), Horrors4You dedicates itself to considering production limitations as part of what allows us to judge your creativity and originality. In our opinion, an independent production shot for a shoestring bud/get should not need to compete with one produced on a larger independent budget for the best prize., Our main competition is divided into the following budget specific awards: Best Scare (for productions made for less than $1,000), Best Biter (for productions made for more than $1,000, but less than $5,000), and - Best Killer (for productions made for more than $5,000)., For Webseries, we have a specific award again: The Longest Bite. This category is dedicated to reoccurring serialized materials of video format (not scripts)., When submitting your project, you are automatically entered into the ‘Other Categories’ competition, which include traditional film technique related areas - such as Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director etc. All films in these areas are judged on an equal level regardless of length or budget constraints. For a complete and up-to-date list of our categories, please visit our site., The script competition for unproduced material is split into three categories: Best Scare, Best Script Technique, Best Micro Budget Script., All selected participants within the main competition will be considered for the Best Scream Prizes (our Jury specific awards)., No films will be selected for our competition without a specific nomination., For an extended review of your film or webseries, please enter Review Project. The reviews average around 300 words each. We are currently unable to provide reviews for unproduced scripts."

We bring it. LUNA is committed to inspiring women, championing change, and demanding that equality be a right, not an option. This is not something we wish for—we’re doing something about it. This fierce attitude fueled us to create LUNAFEST., Almost two decades ago, LUNA Bar saw that women were painfully underrepresented in film. So, in 2001 we created the first all-women traveling film festival. Our first event was a small but hopeful screening in California., Now, LUNAFEST annually showcases the work of 6-10 talented women filmmakers (We’ve opened opportunities for more than 160 women filmmakers since 2001) and serves as a vehicle for raising awareness and funds for causes that women care about. Each year, screenings are held in more than 200 cities and in front of 25,000+ people., To date, LUNAFEST has raised over $5 million and worked with more than 1,600 women’s nonprofits – with 100% of the net proceeds of each event donated directly to charity., Please note: Your film submission fee is donated directly to our partner Chicken & Egg Pictures. Chicken & Egg Pictures supports women nonfiction filmmakers whose artful and innovative storytelling catalyzes social change. The organization envisions a world in which women filmmakers, representing a range of experiences and backgrounds, are fully supported to realize their artistic goals, build sustainable careers, and achieve parity in all areas of the film industry."

        about: "History, Founded in 1974, the AIFVF has been presenting the best in international film for 47 years. Known globally as a festival that supports cinema from underground and marginalized populations, the AIFVF represents the values that we share as a community. It is a champion of justice and provides a voice for underrepresented artists and viewpoints on a global level. For almost five decades, Athens International has embraced experimental, animated, narrative and documentary, short-form and feature length films from every corner of the globe, offering filmmakers a stellar platform for public exposure and an environment that values artistry above marquee names and industry relationships. AIFVF is recognized by the Academy® of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as a qualifying festival in the short narrative and short animation categories., *A Special note about our 2021 festival. Because of the global pandemic we had to reschedule our April 2020 festival to October 2020.

The dates for the festival have also been expanded to allow for twice the number of films. As well, our jury will be awarding twice the number of cash awards.

There are two additional awards chosen by the jury: The Black Bear Award for best use of sound and The Film House Award for visionary filmmaking. Festival Jurors will be announced just prior to the festival and awards will be announced on the final day of the festival., We are an Academy® Qualifying Festival in the Short Narrative, and Animated Short, categories., Competition films are programmed around various themes that emerge from the films selected; our intention is to group films into shows that reflect a common thematic thread. For our 2019 competition 2,500 films were submitted. From these; around 240 films from 60 countries were chosen to screen over the week of the festival., AIFVF is unable to provide screening fees for works in competition but we do our best to provide the best hospitality we can for visiting filmmakers., Filmmaker Perks, The Athens International Film and Video Festival also sponsors guest artists screenings, that often include workshops and additional opportunities for artists to meet with audience members fellow filmmakers and members of our community., All visiting filmmakers and their guests are provided with lunch everyday in our filmmaker lounge during the festival. In the past with help from our sponsors the festival has provided half the cost of hotel rooms for visiting filmmakers as a way to ease the costs associated with visiting Athens during the festival. AIFVF also provides free ground transportation from the Columbus, Ohio airport., We host special workshops and talks for filmmakers by our guest artists. In 2016 Ed Lachman (academy nominated cinematographer of “Carol“ and “Far from Heaven“) and Charles Burnett (“Killer for Sheep“, “To Sleep With Anger“) led discussions and answered questions about their process and careers.

        about: "The Mykonos Biennale is an intellectual event which brings together the work of artists from all over the world to create something new, to break the borders of art, using the telluric energy and hermetic beauty of this cosmopolitan island., The international multicultural events will interact with the local memories, traditions and historical spaces creating a unique experimental event., The art exhibitions, the installations, and performances of the artists, the musicians and dance group will spread through out the monasteries, the museums, the old houses, the ancient island of Delos, the windmills and other monumental buildings, like a treasure map of the old island. The heart of the Mykonos Biennale is the video film festival which in 2019 is divided into two categories:, Video Graffiti - Throughout the old town of Mykonos, famous for its white building and thus often called the bride of the Aegean, art videos will be projected on the walls of houses and gardens transforming this town that never sleeps into a living theatre of video graffiti., Dramatic Nights - A selection narrative short films, documentary and art videos will be screened in the open air theatre of the island and at the important Gryparion center., APATHIA is the theme of the 2019 Mykonos Biennale., Time has aged, fashion repeats itself and the future looks nostalgic. With order globalism has created a new civilization/culture, excessively controlled, unprotected and depressed. Ambition for power and money floats without substance like a bored familiar junkie who has abused everyone and everything. Ancient cities, and treasures of nature disappear. People and animals are abused and all this in a world that is educated with democratic principles and religions touting love. The mind refuses to understand and the repugnant visions accumulate in the bowels of existence. A Pandemic of indigestion overcasts humanity. This serenity is not reminiscent peace. Its an uncomfortable silence, a charged stillness. It is the Silence of the Lambs. Is it love that gives them the power to survive the bloody centuries? Their healing look gifts forgiveness and they who feels it know the answer., Lydia Venieri, Havana 2018"

        rulesAndRegulations: "Rules & Terms, Requirements, Length: Films need to be 40 minutes or less. We prefer most films sit on the shorter end of that spectrum—the average film we feature is 10 minutes. The longer your film (over 15 minutes), the tougher judges we tend to be., Premiere Status: No premiere status is required, however, we give preference to films that haven’t yet premiered online. So, don’t wait to submit your film., Rights: We require films to have all necessary rights and releases secured for us to feature them. Yes, this includes music., Free to View: We only select films that are free for audiences., What to Expect, Learn more about why we do submissions the way we do, what we look for in a film, and see examples of real feedback we offer. Learn more, What We Look For, We look for great stories that brave new territory. We value great characters, interesting new worlds, and stories that surprise us over fancy visual effects, famous actors, or silly one-liners that often feed much of online videos. So when screening films, we tend to score them based on three attributes:, Head—Does it break new ground and have us thinking about something in a new way?, Heart—Does it stir us emotionally?, Hand—Does it exhibit great skill and craftsmanship?, The best way to understand what we look for is to watch the short films in our collection. You can get a good sense of our taste by looking at what we have curated in the past., What We Avoid, We have no hard and fast rules. Every film is different and there are always exceptions. In general, though, the following tend to not be a good fit for us:, Music videos or abstract films with no or little story, Films driven solely by special effects, Commercials or purely promotional pieces (Branded films are okay), Timelapse/travel photography videos, Comedies that rely heavily upon on a single punchline, Profile documentaries that may be interesting but lack a strong narrative arc, Refund Policy, Unfortunately we cannot refund a submission fee once you’ve submitted your film. Please make absolutely sure you want to submit your film before doing so., As with other festivals, your fee is paid for your film to be considered. By no means does submitting your film guarantee that your film will be accepted for Short of the Week. If your film is not accepted, your submission fee is not refunded. We receive thousands of submissions every year and only about 4% are selected (Learn more about our selection process)., If Your Film is Selected,, For every selected film, we employ a unique strategy we’ve developed that we call Be Everywhere At Once. This means we will be your launch partner and provide our expertise gained from launching thousands of films to tailor a strategy for your film’s online launch that maximizes for impact. We will get your film in front of audiences on all the major platforms—YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook, Twitter—and seed it with key media and industry players., Once selected, the fun begins! The first thing we want to know is more about you—your preferences for things like launch date, your hopes for your film, and perhaps most importantly, where you want to go as a filmmaker., You will have the opportunity to specify a preferred launch date for your film, and we will do our best to accommodate—more advanced notice is better., FAQ, Will releasing my film online hurt my chances at film festivals?, This is one of the biggest scares for filmmakers (it was ours, too). So we did the research and found that 2/3rds of the top film festivals will accept online films (66% in 2013). And with heavyweights like Sundance and SXSW leading the charge, this is clearly a growing trend. If you want to know about a specific festival, take a look at our Essential List of Festival Eligibility to see if the festivals you’re considering are online-friendly., Do you accept incomplete films (for example, a film with scratch music)?, Yes. Sending an incomplete film is a great way to get a film on our radar early so that we can best help coordinate a successful launch. If we like your film, we will tentatively accept it. You’ll then be asked to resubmit the final cut (at no extra charge) where we’ll deliver our final verdict., Is Short of the Week affiliated with Vimeo?, No. We operate independently and there is no connection between the two services. All curatorial and editorial decisions are made independently., If I’m accepted to Short of the Week, will I be a Staff Pick on Vimeo?, No. We have no affiliation with Vimeo. While there is certainly overlap between the films we feature and those selected by Vimeo and other film curation sites, we operate under completely independent curatorial guidelines., Where should I host my film for the submission?, We prefer films be uploaded to either Vimeo or YouTube. If your film is not yet released, be sure you keep your film private by setting a password on Vimeo or setting it to unlisted on YouTube., If I’m accepted, can Short of the Week guarantee that my film will go viral?, No, and no one can guarantee that your film will go viral. If anyone tells you differently, they’re simply lying. Number of views is no longer the goal for short films and it shouldn’t be yours. We look to connect your story with producers, agents, and others in the industry who can get you to the next step in your film career., Do you require any exclusivity?, No. We know how harmful exclusivity deals can be to filmmakers. They can tie your film up in a losing distribution channel for months or years and there’s nothing you can do. At Short of the Week, your film becomes part of our very popular archive that is completely searchable by style, genre, and keywords for as long as you wish it to be. If you land a big deal that requires you to pull your film down, we’ll congratulate you and give you a virtual high-5 not throw a contract in your face. Details are in our human-readable licensing agreement., Do you only feature one film a week?, Not anymore. Way back when we first started in 2007, we only posted one film a week (hence the name!). But, now, we feature a film almost every day. The “of the week” moniker has stuck, however., Do you offer submission fee waivers?, Not at this time., Have a question that wasn’t answered here?, Send us a message"

At its 18th edition, the Festival is scheduled to be held from late-June to September – it actually lasts 12 weeks!, Since 2003 CinemadaMare has been hosting every year over 300 filmmakers from over 65 countries around the world. It has screened houndreds of films in the most beautiful italian cities and represents the longest cinema journey (5200 km) across Italy from north to south., As a result CinemadaMare has become the biggest gathering of young filmmakers in the world., The filmmakers are hosted for free throughout the festival. They are divided in crews and shot their films during the festival. Each stage lasts one week and takes place in an Italian city. In this way the filmmakers make the film and have the chance not only to work together with the local people but also to learn the history and the art of many Italian places. This event is not about only one city or region but it moves around – like a gypsy caravan – equipped with its most precious luggage: 100 filmmakers who move from a place to another. They are almost one hundred for each stage given that their attendace to CinemadaMare runs from 3 weeks minimum to 12 weeks maximum. So they alternate and reach the number of 300 every year., After signing up, the filmmakers are selected and benefit from the accomodation provided by the festival: free attendance, free overnight stay, free travels from a place to another. All festival activities are free as well. Round trip and food are not free of charge., Since 2003 CinemadaMare has seen a huge growth. There are more and more filmmakers coming here and the number of the regions involved has increased: Basilicata, Calabria, Campania, Lazio, Apulia, Abruzzo, Liguria, Sardinia, Sicily, Tuscany, Marche, Piedmont, Aosta Valley and Veneto., That is why CinemadaMare is unique: a cultural and artistic experience who turns summer into a big travelling festival across Italy.

        about: "Thank you for considering our festival for your film!, We are looking for the best features, shorts, docs and animation we can find to present in San Francisco. For 22 years SF IndieFest has developed a great reputation for filling theaters, getting press and throwing great parties. Films at our fest regularly get great press reviews, picked up at other fests and find rabid groupies following the makers around town demanding autographs and buying them drinks., --ANNOUNCEMENT: We have every intention to present this festival in a live movie theater. The only reason we would cancel the fest if we can not find a theater in San Francisco to play films. Should that occur, your submission fee will be automatically refunded by FilmFreeway., “I’m certainly happy that IndieFest exists, because it is a celebration of films that don’t necessarily get distributed widely,” HITS director David Cross says, “I’m happy to be a part of it with my film, which is very much in the category of a low-budget, little indie movie. I’m glad there’s a place for it.” – SF Chronicle, “Sundance may have sold out, but SF IndieFest keeps it real” – Annie Lo, Flavorpill, “While the Bay Area is flush with festivals, this one remains an under-the-radar standout.” – Randy Myers, San Jose Mercury News, “The San Francisco Independent Film Festival, the Bay Area’s version of Slamdance, provides a showcase for edgy cinematic work — and a great excuse to do some serious partying.” – David Lewis, San Francisco Chronicle, “For many independent filmmakers, festivals such as SF Indiefest—aka the San Francisco Independent Film Festival–are the only way to bring their works before an audience. For filmgoers, SF Indiefest is the place to see original cinematic works created by directors who want to tell edgy stories which come from their hearts and souls. While some have bemoaned the death of cinema, the curators and filmmakers at SF Indiefest are keeping the craft of film alive.” – David Elijah Nahmod, SF SOUNDS, “SF IndieFest is the one festival of the year where you should throw a dart at the program and take a chance. Not because you’re guaranteed a masterpiece, but because it’s the best fest to see something that would never, ever breach your filter otherwise.” -Michael Fox, KQED, Our SCREENPLAY COMPETITION can be found here: https://filmfreeway.com/SFIndieFestScreenplayCompetition, PRESS COVERAGE, Press Coverage for last year‘s Festival: https://sfindie.com/press-coverage, FILMMAKER COMMENTS ABOUT THE FESTIVAL, “Hey Jeff: Just want to shoot you a quick note of thanks on hosting us at IndieFest and giving us our World Premiere. We had a great time and really enjoyed our time at the fest and in SF; it‘s a great vibe and the diversity of features and shorts in the program made for a really exciting and energized atmosphere. “- Max Gardner, Go/Don‘t Go, “Festivals bring unexpected benefits. Festivals are essential for brand creation. Premiering at Tribeca was enough to convince people to at least listen to me, but surprisingly it was the San Francisco Indie Fest that was just as crucial for our theatrical release. Our press from this festival helped convince the Red Vic to book us in April (I thank the amazing S.F. publicist Karen Larsen for convincing me of this in advance). We also incorporated festivals into our broader theatrical release, and while we did not claim them as cities in our 17-city count, they helped give us something to crow about.“, http://www.filmmakermagazine.com/fall2008/bomb_it.php, “I‘ve got to tell you that Indiefest was one of the greatest experiences of my life. I tell all filmmakers - and festival organizer friends of mine - how you run your fest and how you run each film twice. Every single time people look at me with shocked disbelief. Truly, Bonnie and I loved being a part of the event., Thanks again for including us. SF Indiefest really made me feel that making YEAR was worth the whole effort., Best-, MIKE CARROLL“, “We LOVED San Francisco, meeting other filmmakers, seeing their films, participating in your screenplay panel and of course our awesome sold-out screening. You have one of the most engaged, passionate cinephile audiences I’ve ever seen at a film fest — they were incredible.“ - Warren Sonoda, THINGS I DO FOR MONEY, IndieFest 2020, “You have a great and engaging festival and one that draws on extremely passionate indie film audiences you are rabid for amazing content for which you definitely provide in bunches! You support of us and our film is greatly appreciated and we hope we are privileged To be welcomed back again in the future!“ - Avi F., SF IndieFest is a founding member of the FILM FESTIVAL ALLIANCE"

        about: "SF IndieFest is a founding member of the FILM FESTIVAL ALLIANCE, MISSION & OBJECTIVE, We screen the best documentaries from around the world for two weeks at the Roxie Cinema, the oldest art house theater west of the Mississippi. Many of our titles end up with calendared runs at the Roxie later in the year. We get great coverage in San Francisco, the second largest film market in the country, plus industry reviews., San Francisco is a very receptive town for documentaries and our fest has built a passionate following over the past 19 years., LAST YEAR‘S PRESS COVERAGE: https://sfindie.com/press-coverage, ABOUT SF DOCFEST, SF DocFest is an annual festival devoted to documentary cinema. Since 2001, this two week-long event has brought the most weird and wonderful aspects of real life to the big screen., “Docfest offers a zippy blend of politics, music, social issues and youth-oriented subcultures. The good news is that DocFest promotes documentaries as a vibrant, irreverent form of entertainment to a younger demographic, blasting the notion of educational films to smithereens. There’s no room for anything approximating — watch it, I’m about to blaspheme – the obsessively measured and utterly somnambulant musings of Ken Burns.” – Michael Fox, KQED, “Since its inception, DocFest (May 31-June 15 at the Roxie and the Vogue, with opening night at Alamo Drafthouse) has compiled a colorful scrapbook of genuine characters in contrast to the current events survey, educational seminar or social-issue forum that defines many documentary series… There are one or two people in Off the Charts you won’t soon forget, which could be said about nearly every film in DocFest. That’s one of the pleasures of scrapbooks.” – also Michael Fox, KQED, ABOUT SF INDIEFEST, Comments about SF DocFest parent organization SF IndieFest:, “Festivals bring unexpected benefits. Festivals are essential for brand creation. Premiering at Tribeca was enough to convince people to at least listen to me, but surprisingly it was the San Francisco Indie Fest that was just as crucial for our theatrical release.

In our 20th year we will be actively looking for material that has been produced in the Sacramento region., The Sacramento Film and Music Festival is the longest running non-genre-specific festival in the Sacramento region and, as such, has played host to local, national and international filmmakers, from first-time writer/directors to working industry professionals to veteran Hollywood producers., Each year we select movies in all genres, lengths and formats, from all around the world, and the Festival enjoys an extraordinary track record of picking those that go on to win major awards and/or achieve distribution beyond the festival circuit. Furthermore, we actively pursue those business and creative opportunities for our filmmakers with our industry partners and sponsors., We pride ourselves as an established member of the California arts community and as a premiere showcase for the best of the best in worldwide film arts and were thrilled to be voted Best Film Festival in Sacramento by the readers of the Sacramento News & Review! We are also a repeat recipient of financial support from the Sacramento Metropolitan Arts Commission, as part of a competitive grant program, in recognition of our pro-active approach to arts promotion., We also complement our many days of exclusive film screenings with a single evening of live music, interspersed with music videos that we commission each year as part of a much-heralded and pioneering program, Sac Music Seen, that matches local talents in music and film-making. Over the past ten seasons, we have produced over 200 music videos and we also accept and respect the music video format in our regular submission pool., It is of vital importance that we recognize the new generation of filmmakers and our Student Days program regularly features works by students from such leading film schools as NYU, USC, UCLA, AFI, and Chapman - but we also look for high quality films from unaffiliated and high school students., As a member of the Sacramento Alliance of Film Festivals, the Festival works with our genre festival partners (Sacramento‘s Jewish, French, Gay and Lesbian, and Black film festivals) and we will pass on especially noteworthy submissions if we are not able to screen them ourselves and if they seem well suited to one of our partners. We happily screen in all genres ourselves, however we simply cannot accommodate every movie we are sent, regardless of how exceptional they might be. The Alliance allows us to share our success and pass on the added value of referrals to our contributing filmmakers, when appropriate, and without additional submission costs. Additionally, we consider “off-season“ films for our occasional Gold Circle screening series throughout the year., The Festival also partners in collaborative projects with the Capital Film Arts Alliance (formerly the Sacramento Film Group), another noteworthy winner of local Arts Council funding, and the oldest uniquely dedicated networking group of filmmakers in the Capital region., We have been fortunate over the years to receive great attention from the press and it is our pleasure to work to promote the work of our filmmakers in advance of each year‘s Festival. There are some advantages to being the senior all-genre festival in the area and we are extremely grateful to our partners and supporters."

Rome still remains the heart of Italian film, with a large community of industry people and cultured cinema fans alike, which makes it the perfect setting to celebrate the diversity of independent cinema, at Rome Independent Cinema Festival., As indie cinema works slightly outside of the mainstream, its position leaves room for both experimentation and artistic growth. On the other hand it needs more help reaching the right audience, therefore it has to be recognized and celebrated for its cultural value., Our aim is to merge a cultural, inspiring program with an entertaining event, where people can have a unique experience of being artistically stimulated, while having a fun evening, meeting likeminded people in the open-air, Casa del Cinema of Rome. Submit your film and you might be included in our diverse program, and you will also have a chance to win one of our many awards., Thank you to our sponsors and partners: Devent VFX Studio and Fonderia delle Arti!"

        about: "The first Manchester Experimental Film Festival took place from 8th to the 15th of March 2020 at the Holden Gallery, Manchester Craft and Design centre and Saul Hay Gallery and was a huge success!, For the 2021 event we‘re looking to expand to even more gallery loactions across the city., All selected films will screen in a selection of Manchester’s contemporary art galleries., This format gives experimental films the room to breathe that they deserve, allowing audiences and artists who have specific interest in the form the opportunity to experience experimental films in an environment more suited to the medium., This also gives experimental filmmakers the chance to present their work to a wider audience of both fans of contemporary art and the general public., MANIFF director of programming Alan Bailey says ‘over the years at MANIFF it has become clear that experimental films are an art form all of their own and screening them alongside standard narrative short films means the complexity and beauty of experimental filmmaking is lost. Showing these films in a gallery will give audiences the chance to take in what they have seen in a more reflective manner’, This event allows us to showcase experimental film and opens new possibilities for the medium in the city of Manchester."

Los sujetos de ese lugar que nos lleva a un espacio de reflexión y de encuentro con los sentimientos de paz y armonía., En la construcción del perfil del FesticineKids 22, se problematiza a la pantalla como punto de confluencia de niñas, niños y adolescentes. Al postular al cine como ese escenario en el que se exteriorizan sentimientos, emociones y creencias, se pretende que las niñas, niños y adolescentes, entendiendo lo que el cine les evoca, lo que extraen de él y sus significaciones, se pregunten sobre el lugar que el cine tiene en sus vidas, en su entorno, en paralelo al lugar que quieren y sueñan., También es una oportunidad para que los adultos, padres de familia, docentes autoridades culturales y cinematográficas piensen sobre la necesidad de fortalecer sus capacidades de ser formadores en tensión e interacción con los medios audiovisuales de comunicación, especialmente el cine."

It’s not afraid to watch videos with 27 views on YouTube, it’s missing the “least popular” sorting option on itch.io and considers Festival Scope Pro decidedly “too mainstream”., The heart of the festival are four international competitions, in which the audience decides about the awarding of prizes. The Black Horse of Film (feature films from all over the world) and the Black Horse of Animation (short features) present the cinematographic debuts by directors from the entire world, often as their Polish premieres. The Black Horse of Video Games and the Black Horse of Music Video are devoted to new games and music videos., Additionally, every year festivalgoers are treated to: screenings of films, animations and music videos, video game exhibitions, virtual reality and new technologies, discussion panels and Q&As with artists, concerts, live acts and musical afterparties., In previous years, the festival hosted a variety of artists from all over the world, including Béla Tarr, Nina Menkes, Phil Mulloy, Laila Pakalnina, Bruce LaBruce, Tami Tamaki, Stephen „M.O.O.N.” Gilarde, Jakuba Dvorský, Mariola Brillowska, Piotr Dumała, Arkadiusz Jakubik, Bodo Kox, Łukasz Barczyk, Sos Sosowski, Wiktor Stribog and Władysław Komendarek., The event is organized by the culture institution Katowice the City of Gardens and the City of Katowice."

        about: "The World Festival of Animated Film – Animafest Zagreb, established in 1972, is the second oldest film festival in the world completely dedicated to animation. Launched thanks to the global reputation of the filmmakers sprung from the Zagreb School of Animation, founded based on the decision of ASIFA, International Animated Film Association, Zagreb Film production company and City of Zagreb, Animafest Zagreb takes place every year early in June. Until 2005 the festival was held biennially, and afterwards continued in the annual rhythm, devoting even years to short film and odd years to feature film. After Zagreb Film and Zagreb Concert Management, in 2007 the festival organisation was taken over by the private production company Hulahop with the aim of further development and balancing the programme with the requirements of contemporary tendencies, approaching broader audiences and providing added values to professionals. In 2015 Animafest Zagreb merged short and feature festival editions and became festival dedicated to animation in all its forms on annual basis.\n\nAnimafest Zagreb always has been, alongside festivals in Annecy, Ottawa and Hiroshima, a part of the obligatory circuit in the animation community’s calendar. Animafest’s Grand Prix winners directly qualify for the Academy Award and the European Animation Award.\n\nMission\nAs one of the leading international animation events and the only Croatian film festival with such a status, Animafest Zagreb serves as a bridge between the animation scene and the local audience (more than 80 per cent of the selection consists of premieres), but also actively creates it, continually raising the level of audiovisual culture in the society. The Zagreb festival therefore presents the best and latest works competing for prestigious awards and the most relevant and interesting trends. Through entertainment, socialisation and learning, Animafest connects citizens of all generations and respected guests from different parts of the world at a large and colourful festivity paying tribute to animation art.\n\nThis is a festival by the filmmakers for the filmmakers. Creative animation, in all its different forms – from traditional drawings, to stop motion, CGI, to most experimental cross-media explorations – has been the focus of attention since the very beginning Daniel Šuljić, Art Director\n\n"

        about: "The American Film Institute (AFI) is an American film organization that educates filmmakers and honors the heritage of the motion picture arts in the United States. AFI is supported by private funding and public membership fees.\n\nThe American Film Institute is dedicated to celebrating excellence in the art form and to creating national education initiatives that inspire artists and audiences alike. AFI values : \nA Commitment to Excellence\nA Belief in the Power of Storytelling to Change the World\nA Dedication to Community\nIn equity & inclusion\n\nThe American Film Institute was founded by a 1965 presidential mandate announced in the Rose Garden of the White House by Lyndon B. Johnson—to establish a national arts organization to preserve the legacy of American film heritage, educate the next generation of filmmakers, and honor the artists and their work. Two years later, in 1967, AFI was established, supported by the National Endowment for the Arts, the Motion Picture Association of America and the Ford Foundation.[3]\n\nThe original 22-member Board of Trustees included actor Gregory Peck as chairman and actor Sidney Poitier as vice-chairman, as well as director Francis Ford Coppola, film historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., lobbyist Jack Valenti, and other representatives from the arts and academia.[4]\n\nThe institute established a training program for filmmakers known then as the Center for Advanced Film Studies. Also created in the early years were a repertory film exhibition program at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and the AFI Catalog of Feature Films — a scholarly source for American film history. The institute moved to its current eight-acre Hollywood campus in 1981.[5] The film training program grew into the AFI Conservatory, an accredited graduate school.\n\nAFI moved its presentation of first-run and auteur films from the Kennedy Center to the historic AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural Center, which hosts the AFI DOCS film festival, making AFI the largest nonprofit film exhibitor in the world. AFI educates audiences and recognizes artistic excellence through its awards programs and 10 Top 10 Lists.\n\nIt is the only festival of its stature that is free to the public. \n\nAFI FEST is the longest-running international film festival in Los Angeles. Each fall, AFI FEST presents the year's most significant films. Featuring international work from emerging filmmakers, global showcases of films from the great masters and red-carpet gala premieres, AFI FEST brings the very best of world cinema to the city of Los Angeles, the film capital of the world. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognizes AFI FEST as a qualifying festival for the Short Films category of the annual Academy Awards. "

Domestic Categories include Animation, Documentary, Narrative, and Alternative/Experimental (includes International as well)., 2. International Categories include Animation, Documentary, Narrative and Alternative/Experimental (includes domestic as well)., 3. Category Descriptions, a. ANIMATION - Animated films may present an original narrative story, an existing story or fable, or an exploration of a mood or thought. Either comical or serious, they usually fall into one of two general fields -- character animation or abstract animation. Various techniques include cel animation, computer animation, clay animation, stop-motion, pixilation, cut-out pins, camera multiple-pass imagery, kaleidoscope effects, and drawing on the film frame itself. Winning Animation films are chosen by judging the product as a whole, as well as the artistic and technical skill of the filmmaker in whatever motif or animation technique the student has chosen., b. DOCUMENTARY - Documentary films are nonfiction visual essays that seek to present historical subjects, current social or political issues, or specific human experiences in such a way as to have a dramatic impact upon the viewing audience. Documentaries may be filmed in the cinéma vérité style where camera and microphone merely record the event without injecting the comments or subjective conclusions of the filmmaker, or may be a reenactment. In the latter case, the distinction between dramatic and documentary film lies in the fact that while dramatic film is fictional, documentary film deals with factual situations and circumstances. Winning films in this category are chosen on the basis of artistic technique, as well as the ability of the documentarian to fashion reality into a film essay which leaves the audience better informed and/or moved., c. NARRATIVE - Narrative films strive to portray life, a character or a narrative story much the same way a novel does, but within the context of an audiovisual medium. Past narrative films by students have included, but were not limited to, dramas, comedies, musicals, and many other story oriented genres. Winning entries in this and all other categories reflect the merit of the film when viewed as a whole, as well as the professional execution of its component parts, such as script, dialogue, direction, cinematography, lighting, acting, editing and scoring. Narrative category films may be adaptations of existing pieces of literature or original stories written by the student filmmaker., d. ALTERNATIVE/EXPERIMENTAL – Films submitted in this category risk disqualification if they could also be submitted in any other category (i.e. the narrative, documentary, or animation categories, as defined by these rules). This category is not meant to be a “catch all” category for films that have unusual narratives or simply lack structure and/or craftsmanship. Alternative films challenge traditional cinematic boundaries and conventions of expression. Alternative films employ progressive aesthetic and/or technical elements. Alternative films convey a reinterpretation of traditional structural components such as story, imagery, words, time, space, motion, sound, light and color. Alternative films often expand the language of cinema and generally are non-narrative and may not necessarily have a story arc. The Academy strictly evaluates if films submitted in this category are appropriately Alternative., Student Academy Awards Approved Formats, 1. Approved formats include:, a. HD quality digital file (min. resolution of 1920x1080): Quicktime (Pro Res 422. Pro Res 4444), AVI, H.264, b. DCP, i. Aspect Ratio: 1.78, 1.85, 2.39, ii.

        synopsisLongEN: "THE END OF THE WORLD is an intimate, creative and very immensely visual documentary where couple of stories weave into one narrative during in one night. In a big city, many people are joined in one need - troubled by loneliness, they want to talk to someone. Some of them call an emergency number 112, even if it’s not really necessary, others call the radio. This time the subject of the broadcast is the end of the world predicted by the Mayan calendar. The speaker asks the listeners what it actually means to each one of them. They talk about things that are tragic and painful, and sometimes small and funny. Their need to be heard, to communicate, to share their experience with someone else is evident and moving. The radio is a motif linking this night’s events - we hear it in the ambulance, in a city’s monitoring centre, where we observe the night life of the city presented on dozens of screens. The radio binds the elements of the film together in terms of structure and meaning: it is the source of the most important questions."

        synopsisLongEN: "A tour of the place will prove that sometimes one painting is not enough. Aditional information: The starting point is experimentation. For this film Damián Alquichire created around 3000 paintings and 1500 drawings. There are a lot of techniques used: oils, vinyls, charcoal and pencils in different surfaces, from little papers (25x35cms) to big canvases (150x120cms). The film also had the honour of having original music composed by the most prolific colombian academic composer of all times: Blas Atehortúa."
